ukraine,Volunteering in civilian roles,"Hi,

I’m an American. When the war broke out, I was doing my bachelor’s in Vilnius, and knew immediately that I had to do my part to help Ukraine. I became a teacher, teaching English to some of the thousands of Ukrainian refugees who came into Lithuania. Now though, I’ve graduated and don’t have much to do, and most of all, don’t feel like I have a purpose.

I am desperately searching for meaningful work, and the most meaningful work I’ve done to date has been the aforementioned teaching job, helping Ukrainians. This is a theme I want to continue, and as directly as possible—in Ukraine itself if necessary. 

My question therefore is if there are civilian military support roles I could fill in Ukraine, as a volunteer. I don’t have any military experience, but I’m a pretty capable person when it comes to clerical work, teaching, writing, research, or outreach. Really, I’m open to anything.

The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace

  


  


By Olena Komar

  


In this article, I demonstrate a series of biases against Ukrainians in Western countries, which I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome” (by analogy with the “North African syndrome”). These prejudices have emerged due to how Ukrainians speak about the war and how they are perceived in connection with Western European stereotypical expectations. Furthermore, these prejudices have a colonial nature, stemming from an inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians. This bias is reinforced by historical short-sightedness, influenced by pro-Russian sentiment in Slavic studies as well as by pseudo-pacifism.

  


Pseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence but also to shift the blame onto the victims—denying them the right to self-determination and the capacity to make informed decisions about their fate. These prejudices are also a form of epistemic injustice, which must be confronted by rooting out ignorance. Such ignorance can be intentional, serving the interests of the oppressor by sustaining misunderstanding of the experience and suffering of the oppressed.

  


There are several levels of epistemic injustice:

  


1. Stereotyping Ukrainians’ struggle for survival and identity as a manifestation of belligerence;
2. Rejection of war as a negative phenomenon is projected onto war victims—their experiences and emotions become unwanted. This leads to silencing or victimization;
3. Injustice of testimony and gaslighting result from “blind spots” in people’s knowledge: a distrust of Ukrainians’ accounts and understanding of their own history and of Russians;
4. Unjust equalization, coercion into peace and compromises that benefit only the aggressor.

  


  


  


Negativity or Resistance to Oppression?

  


  


A Ukrainian athlete refused to shake hands with a Russian athlete, Ukrainian writers declined to participate in a joint panel discussion with a Russian writer, and Ukrainian scholars protested against the idea of delegates from Russian universities participating in a conference.

  


How do Western Europeans react to such news? Do they view these actions as legitimate, just, reasonable? Most often, such events escalate into scandals, and the Ukrainians involved are accused of xenophobia, racism, or nationalism, cruelty, aggression, and discrimination, because Ukrainians distrust talk about peace negotiations, refuse to build “bridges of friendship” between intellectuals, and their statements are interpreted as hate speech.

  


Is there something wrong with the Ukrainians themselves and how they deliver their messages? Or is the problem on the side of the listeners, in how they perceive these messages and their trust in the speakers? I want to draw attention here to the latter.

  


The stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied plays into the hands of Russian propaganda, which tries to portray Ukrainians as simply “bad Russians.” In my opinion, without a proper understanding of hermeneutical injustice, the harm caused is likely to grow—reinforcing the formation of what I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”

  


  


What Are the Preconditions for This Argument, and Where Does the Term Come From?

  


  


I use this term by analogy with the one used by Frantz Fanon, who introduced the “North African Syndrome” in his essay of the same name. This is not a medical diagnosis but a prejudice held by French psychiatrists toward North African inhabitants. Modern science recognizes this syndrome as a manifestation of racist colonial bias—under which North Africans were seen as lazy or overly emotional.

  


This viewpoint did not necessarily stem from malice on the part of individual doctors, but rather from stereotypical perceptions of Africans as mentally inferior and emotionally unstable—perceptions shaped by colonial attitudes. This bias arose unconsciously as a result of institutional instruction—but does that absolve the doctors from responsibility for their own ignorance?

  


Modern science considers such ignorance blameworthy and irresponsible because, first, it could have been avoided and corrected through proper epistemic conduct, and second, it harms others and therefore is not innocent.

  


Many studies have been devoted to decolonizing knowledge and to the concept of “white optics” or “white ignorance,” which allows one to “not see” numerous discriminatory manifestations.

  


And yet there is still no clear understanding of the place of white Slavic peoples in Europe, who for much of the last few centuries have been more oppressed than oppressors.

  


  


The Lack of a Hermeneutical Perspective Toward Ukrainians

  


  


The absence of a hermeneutical perspective regarding Ukrainians as Eastern Europeans who, for most of their history, were enslaved, restricted in rights, oppressed, or engaged in struggles against attempts at genocidal extermination has extremely harmful consequences for understanding the present-day Ukrainian condition.

  


Imposing a Western European optic onto Ukrainians leads to dramatic distortions because Ukrainians historically have been neither a privileged part of the Western world with its colonialism, nor do they identify with the “Russian world” and its imperial ambitions.

  


Anti-colonial and anti-racist criticism also often misses the mark, since Ukrainians are not “white privileged oppressors.” Therefore, accusations of racism for helping Ukrainian refugees—which are often inflamed by Russian propaganda abroad—are deliberately divisive messages.

  


At the same time, Ukrainians have never been perceived by the West as a distinct oppressed community, because they were viewed only through the Russian colonial optic as “the edge of Russia” or as “Little Russians.” This was reinforced by both the Soviet myth of the equality of brotherly republics and the Russian myth of the “younger brother.” The current rhetoric of the Russian regime toward Ukrainians is even worse, consisting of the total denial of Ukrainian subjectivity—as “bad Russians” or even as a “virus.”

  


As a result, Ukrainian identity is extremely blurred in the Western European focus, and in many aspects—including language—there is a blind spot. For example, refugee assistance centers abroad default to offering help from Russian-speaking interpreters. This has led to Ukrainians becoming invisible and unheard in their uniqueness, and being perceived with prejudice or mistrust, while their epistemic status has been downgraded.

  


Since many Europeans are only now encountering Ukrainians personally for the first time, they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions. This may give the impression that most Ukrainians are dissatisfied, negative, belligerent, and intolerant. But today’s image of Ukrainians is being shaped by the extraordinary circumstances of resisting an invasion—and by the world’s inadequate response to it—not by any “natural state” of Ukrainians themselves.

  


  


Bravery or Belligerence?

  


  


At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, social media and lightboxes in European, U.S., and Canadian cities were flooded with the slogan: “Be brave like Ukraine.” The world was amazed by the courage with which Ukrainians resisted an enemy whose territory is over 28 times larger, whose population is five times greater, and whose military is the “second-largest army in the world,” equipped with nuclear weapons.

  


Yet even this slogan faced criticism, with some saying it “normalizes” and “encourages” continuation of the war—something Europeans hoped never to see again. It’s easy to ignore a war in the center of Europe: just close your eyes to the Ukrainians who have brought their misfortune with them—or blame them for what’s happening.

  


  


A Personal Anecdote

  


  


“My son, age 10, visibly tenses when I suggest adding a slide with a photo of the destroyed museum to his school presentation in Vienna about the Ukrainian artist Mariia Prymachenko. On February 25, 2022, the museum in the town of Ivankiv, which housed a collection of the artist’s paintings, was destroyed by the Russian army during their advance on Kyiv.

  


Of course, Austrian teachers and students will love Prymachenko’s fantastical animals, birds, and flowers—works admired by Pablo Picasso. They are colorful and joyful. But why should they see that the artist’s museum was destroyed by Russian soldiers? They might not even like that you mention “Russian”—there’s a Russian student in class, it might make him uncomfortable, and that could be labeled as ‘xenophobia.’”

  


Even a young child in primary school quickly learns that Ukrainians with “their war” do not fit the standards of pacifist countries—especially German-speaking ones.

  


Are our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation.





  


European Pacifism and the Rejection of Ukrainian Pain

  


  


The pacifism of modern Germans and Austrians—their rejection of nationalism and aggression in any form—has a clear historical basis: a desire to forget and cleanse themselves after World War II from the image of a nation burdened with collective guilt for Nazi crimes or, at the very least, for their failure to resist evil.

  


Those who, more than anyone, should understand what Ukrainians feel today—once again victims of aggression—prefer not to reopen wounds of memory, even if that means ignoring the destruction of Ukrainians.

  


But there is a huge difference between renouncing the idea of attacking other countries and denying others their right to defend themselves by any means available when they are attacked.

  


  


“Kriegmüde” – War-Weary

  


  


“Kriegmüde” (literally “tired of war”) is a new German word I learned from a letter from another school. Europeans are tired of the war, of high prices, of helping refugees, and they ask us: “When will there be peace? Why don’t Ukrainians compromise?”

  


But can Ukrainians afford to be tired of the war? Do they keep talking about it because they want it to continue?

  


Si vis pacem, para bellum — “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Peace will come through justice, not through compromise if that compromise is rotten.

  


According to Professor Margalit, author of On Compromise and Rotten Compromises, those compromises that preserve a regime of cruelty and humiliation are morally unacceptable—even in the name of peace.

  


  


This Isn’t the First Time the West Has Looked Away

  


  


This is not the first time in world history that Western Europeans have not wanted to know about the destruction of Ukrainians by Russians.

  


At present, “peace” for Ukraine on Russian terms means slow, systematic extermination, as has happened in previous periods of history. In his 1983 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe, Czech writer Milan Kundera—himself exiled because of Soviet aggression—criticized Western Europeans for not valuing what other Europeans were ready to die for.

  


He wrote:

  


“One of the great European peoples (almost forty million Ukrainians) is slowly disappearing. And this immense, nearly unbelievable event is taking place, and the world does not notice it.”

  


  


  


  


Allies Stabbing in the Back

  


  


Ukrainians are genuinely angered and frustrated by a number of topics related to false or misguided support from allies—especially when these same allies simultaneously express support for supposedly “good Russians” or try to build “bridges of friendship” with them.

  


Since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, many Western institutions—including universities and academies—have issued public statements that repeat the phrase:

  


“We support Ukrainians and brave Russians who oppose the war.”

  


But this seemingly inclusive language is deeply flawed. First, it equates the aggressor and the victim. Second, it places the virtue label “brave” on Russians, while Ukrainians are merely pitied as victims. Third, it often borrows Ukrainian symbols to promote Russian Studies, which many Ukrainians perceive as an act of appropriation.

  


Even if well-intentioned, these gestures often backfire. Ukrainians feel betrayed, silenced, or spoken over. This is a form of gaslighting—and as scholar Rachel McKinnon explains, betrayal by an ally hurts especially deeply. It is compounded by “westsplaining” and “russsplaining”: imposing Western or Russian colonial views on Ukrainians, who are framed through Russian-dominated academic lenses.

  


  


  


  


False Equivalence and Real Injustice

  


  


A disturbing example: the Finnish Migration Service housed Russian men avoiding mobilization in the same shelters as Ukrainian refugee women and children. This was traumatic and dangerous for the Ukrainian women—but it stemmed from an epistemic blind spot, a refusal to differentiate between the oppressed and the complicit.

  


This kind of moral flattening continues in many forms:

  


* Demanding Ukrainian victims engage in panels with “brave Russians”
* Framing the war as a “family conflict”
* Calling for equal dialogue between an aggressor and their victim

  


  


Such gestures are not neutral. They entrench injustice. Real justice means amplifying Ukrainian voices, prioritizing the needs of the oppressed, and resisting narratives that “both-sides” the war.

  


  


  


  


What Real Parity Requires

  


  


Equal negotiations cannot occur until:

  


1. Full cessation of aggression and guarantees against future attacks
2. Compensation for historical discrimination
3. Transformation of social structures to eliminate injustice
4. Affirmative support for the voices of the historically oppressed

  


  


Only then can genuine parity be discussed. Otherwise, reconciliation efforts only entrench discrimination and deepen epistemic injustice.

  


  


  


  


Conclusion

  


  


The literature on decolonizing knowledge and epistemic injustice is relatively new. Yet Ukraine remains almost a tabula rasa in that discourse.

  


Western Europe faces a historic choice:

Either to finally discover the real Ukraine—

or to unwittingly assist Russian propaganda in cultivating the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”

**Subject: Urgent Action Needed to Prevent Trump from Undermining Ukraine and our NATO allies.**

**Dear \[Representative's Name\],**

I am writing to express my deep concern over reports that Donald Trump may attempt to bypass our NATO allies and pressure Ukraine into an unfavorable settlement with Vladimir Putin. Such a maneuver would not only betray our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty—it would corrode U.S. credibility and embolden authoritarian regimes worldwide. The stakes could not be higher.

Ukraine has demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression. Our NATO allies have stood resolute alongside them, affirming the principle that free nations have the right to chart their own destinies without coercion. Any attempt to force Ukraine into a deal on Putin's terms would strike at the heart of democracy, international law, and the collective security architecture the United States helped build and lead.

That is why I urge you to take immediate and decisive action to prevent any unilateral moves—by Trump or anyone else—that might compromise our alliances, appease authoritarianism, or undercut global security. Specifically, I ask you to:

1. **Publicly reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO and to Ukraine’s sovereignty.** It is essential we send a clear, bipartisan message that America keeps its word—and stands with those who defend freedom.
2. **Support legislation that strengthens congressional oversight of foreign policy,** preventing any administration from bypassing allies or making backroom deals that endanger global stability.
3. **Advocate for sustained and expanded military and economic aid to Ukraine,** including lifting any remaining restrictions on the delivery of long-range weapons systems. Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength—not while one hand is tied behind its back.
4. **Impose new, robust sanctions on Russia,** targeting sectors that continue to bankroll its war machine and signaling that aggression will be met with escalating consequences, not diplomatic reward.
5. **Champion legislation that protects Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers,** particularly in light of Trump’s radical anti-immigration agenda. No one fleeing Putin’s war should be subjected to deportation or bureaucratic purgatory in the United States.

The American people overwhelmingly support Ukraine’s fight for freedom. We cannot allow political expediency or authoritarian nostalgia to erode that support. History is watching—and the cost of appeasement is always paid in blood.

Thank you for your leadership and commitment to democratic values. I look forward to your response and to seeing bold, principled action on this issue.

ukraine,Looking forward - would love to hear ppl's thoughts on eventual reconstruction,"Sorry for the vague question, but I only have a vague understanding. Appreciate any input!

I started following Ukraine/Euro news at the start of the war and I'm looking for others' thoughts to deepen my admittedly simplistic view. Would also love accessible resources (podcasts, YT) that go into this regularly. I mostly rely on the Times radio show which is more present/retrospective, not future-oriented.

From everything I've seen it looks like Ukraine is could be poised to become the next Poland, socially/economically once Russia collapses (god willing). Obviously there are big challenges (population decline, corruption, etc.) but I'm saying the potential is there.

My thinking is like this:

Europe knows Ukraine is its best defense against future Russian activity, so it's reasonable to expect extensive aid incoming. The war (in my understanding) has already done a lot to bring Ukraine closer to western Europe in terms of tech, culture, and training. The gov. has been working closely with EU monitors to bring their legal code/corruption standards up to par.

The Ukrainian ppl themselves are unified in a way most countries never experience - they've been actively fighting against Russian influence for more than a decade at this point. I know there's a lot of internal bickering but on the big issues it seems like everyone is on the same page.

Foreign investors would love comparatively cheap, educated labor as long as they felt secure there. And I feel like Ukraine has a strong understanding of western business culture, and the ppl are educated and tech-savvy. The returning refugees also have the potential to bring additional connections, etc. 

**So what might be some serious or interesting challenges? Opportunities?**

For example, I recently learned that a lot of the farm land is in some kind of legal limbo due to soviet-era collective ownership. Sorting that out alone seems like both a huge hurdle and opportunity.

Would really love to hear any thoughts. And if I'm mistaken/dumb, please correct me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1kv8pul/looking_forward_would_love_to_hear_ppls_thoughts/,2025-05-25 19:56:51,refugee,14
ukraine,I’m worried for my Ukrainian friend who is scared she’ll have to return to the Ukraine and leave the UK,"hello, 
I’m not Ukrainian but my friend is. I’m not sure this is the right sub for this topic but I didn’t have a lot of luck in the UK subs (due to anti immigration views taking over reddit), so if you think this is the wrong sub Id appreciate direction on where to post this.

I have a colleague who has become a good friend of mine who is struggling right now with her immigration status in the UK. 
She is Ukrainian, from West Ukraine (not sure where exactly right now but can provide this info at a later time when I asked her). She came here 3 years ago via the Ukraine Scheme when her area in Ukraine was deemed as risky. She has a good and secure job here now, a partner and a life. 

About 6 months ago she was excited because she received the news that this kind of refugee visa has been extended for another 2 years after her expiry date which is July 2025.

However, recently she told me that news broke of changes within the scheme which wouldn’t grant her an automatic 2 year extension. She’d now have to apply for it to be extended for another 1.5 years, and that is if she will even be accepted for extension. The area she is from has been deemed as “non risk” by UK immigration. Which is not true for the actual residents living in her city, as her sister is still there with currently no electricity in a really harsh winter.

I am worried for her to be sent back to the Ukraine as it is simply not safe, despite what immigration says. She built up a life here and has made use of her time here. It’s so unfair.

After she told me about all of this, we discussed her options. She is currently working in a good position within the hospitality industry with a good salary. However, this job would not qualify for a working visa. Our boss likes her and said he could apply to be her sponsor so she could get the working visa, although this is a long and expensive process which in the end could all be for nothing if it was rejected in the end. 

She was thinking of going to University to get a student visa and then go the legal work visa route to stay in the UK, but that wouldn’t be possible if she will be refused for an extension on her current status as she needs the time to make all this happen.

She is going to apply for the 1,5-year-extension this summer however she’s worried as she read that many Ukrainians have been refused. a friend of hers from the same region has been accepted for the extension. the friend doesn’t speak english and we are unsure what are the requirements to be accepted for it. 

Has anybody dealt with similar when looking for refuge? how are you guys dealing with this and if there are any Ukrainians in the UK here, what would be her best course of action in this? I really want her to stay in the UK. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1kp2cmp/im_worried_for_my_ukrainian_friend_who_is_scared/,2025-05-17 22:21:53,refugee,39

This has led to Ukrainians becoming invisible and unheard in their uniqueness, and being perceived with prejudice or mistrust, while their epistemic status has been downgraded.

  


Since many Europeans are only now encountering Ukrainians personally for the first time, they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions. This may give the impression that most Ukrainians are dissatisfied, negative, belligerent, and intolerant. But today’s image of Ukrainians is being shaped by the extraordinary circumstances of resisting an invasion—and by the world’s inadequate response to it—not by any “natural state” of Ukrainians themselves.

  


  


Bravery or Belligerence?

  


  


At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, social media and lightboxes in European, U.S., and Canadian cities were flooded with the slogan: “Be brave like Ukraine.” The world was amazed by the courage with which Ukrainians resisted an enemy whose territory is over 28 times larger, whose population is five times greater, and whose military is the “second-largest army in the world,” equipped with nuclear weapons.

  


Yet even this slogan faced criticism, with some saying it “normalizes” and “encourages” continuation of the war—something Europeans hoped never to see again. It’s easy to ignore a war in the center of Europe: just close your eyes to the Ukrainians who have brought their misfortune with them—or blame them for what’s happening.

  


  


A Personal Anecdote

  


  


“My son, age 10, visibly tenses when I suggest adding a slide with a photo of the destroyed museum to his school presentation in Vienna about the Ukrainian artist Mariia Prymachenko. On February 25, 2022, the museum in the town of Ivankiv, which housed a collection of the artist’s paintings, was destroyed by the Russian army during their advance on Kyiv.

  


Of course, Austrian teachers and students will love Prymachenko’s fantastical animals, birds, and flowers—works admired by Pablo Picasso. They are colorful and joyful. But why should they see that the artist’s museum was destroyed by Russian soldiers? They might not even like that you mention “Russian”—there’s a Russian student in class, it might make him uncomfortable, and that could be labeled as ‘xenophobia.’”

  


Even a young child in primary school quickly learns that Ukrainians with “their war” do not fit the standards of pacifist countries—especially German-speaking ones.

  


Are our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation.





  


European Pacifism and the Rejection of Ukrainian Pain

  


  


The pacifism of modern Germans and Austrians—their rejection of nationalism and aggression in any form—has a clear historical basis: a desire to forget and cleanse themselves after World War II from the image of a nation burdened with collective guilt for Nazi crimes or, at the very least, for their failure to resist evil.

  


Those who, more than anyone, should understand what Ukrainians feel today—once again victims of aggression—prefer not to reopen wounds of memory, even if that means ignoring the destruction of Ukrainians.

  


But there is a huge difference between renouncing the idea of attacking other countries and denying others their right to defend themselves by any means available when they are attacked.

  


  


“Kriegmüde” – War-Weary

  


  


“Kriegmüde” (literally “tired of war”) is a new German word I learned from a letter from another school. Europeans are tired of the war, of high prices, of helping refugees, and they ask us: “When will there be peace? Why don’t Ukrainians compromise?”

  


But can Ukrainians afford to be tired of the war? Do they keep talking about it because they want it to continue?

  


Si vis pacem, para bellum — “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Peace will come through justice, not through compromise if that compromise is rotten.

  


According to Professor Margalit, author of On Compromise and Rotten Compromises, those compromises that preserve a regime of cruelty and humiliation are morally unacceptable—even in the name of peace.

  


  


This Isn’t the First Time the West Has Looked Away

  


  


This is not the first time in world history that Western Europeans have not wanted to know about the destruction of Ukrainians by Russians.

  


At present, “peace” for Ukraine on Russian terms means slow, systematic extermination, as has happened in previous periods of history. In his 1983 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe, Czech writer Milan Kundera—himself exiled because of Soviet aggression—criticized Western Europeans for not valuing what other Europeans were ready to die for.

  


He wrote:

  


“One of the great European peoples (almost forty million Ukrainians) is slowly disappearing. And this immense, nearly unbelievable event is taking place, and the world does not notice it.”

  


  


  


  


Allies Stabbing in the Back

  


  


Ukrainians are genuinely angered and frustrated by a number of topics related to false or misguided support from allies—especially when these same allies simultaneously express support for supposedly “good Russians” or try to build “bridges of friendship” with them.

  


Since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, many Western institutions—including universities and academies—have issued public statements that repeat the phrase:

  


“We support Ukrainians and brave Russians who oppose the war.”

  


But this seemingly inclusive language is deeply flawed. First, it equates the aggressor and the victim. Second, it places the virtue label “brave” on Russians, while Ukrainians are merely pitied as victims. Third, it often borrows Ukrainian symbols to promote Russian Studies, which many Ukrainians perceive as an act of appropriation.

  


Even if well-intentioned, these gestures often backfire. Ukrainians feel betrayed, silenced, or spoken over. This is a form of gaslighting—and as scholar Rachel McKinnon explains, betrayal by an ally hurts especially deeply. It is compounded by “westsplaining” and “russsplaining”: imposing Western or Russian colonial views on Ukrainians, who are framed through Russian-dominated academic lenses.

  


  


  


  


False Equivalence and Real Injustice

  


  


A disturbing example: the Finnish Migration Service housed Russian men avoiding mobilization in the same shelters as Ukrainian refugee women and children. This was traumatic and dangerous for the Ukrainian women—but it stemmed from an epistemic blind spot, a refusal to differentiate between the oppressed and the complicit.

  


This kind of moral flattening continues in many forms:

  


* Demanding Ukrainian victims engage in panels with “brave Russians”
* Framing the war as a “family conflict”
* Calling for equal dialogue between an aggressor and their victim

  


  


Such gestures are not neutral. They entrench injustice. Real justice means amplifying Ukrainian voices, prioritizing the needs of the oppressed, and resisting narratives that “both-sides” the war.

  


  


  


  


What Real Parity Requires

  


  


Equal negotiations cannot occur until:

  


1. Full cessation of aggression and guarantees against future attacks
2. Compensation for historical discrimination
3. Transformation of social structures to eliminate injustice
4. Affirmative support for the voices of the historically oppressed

  


  


Only then can genuine parity be discussed. Otherwise, reconciliation efforts only entrench discrimination and deepen epistemic injustice.

  


  


  


  


Conclusion

  


  


The literature on decolonizing knowledge and epistemic injustice is relatively new. Yet Ukraine remains almost a tabula rasa in that discourse.

I’m planning a short trip from Košice and was thinking about crossing into western Ukraine, specifically to visit Uzhhorod and Mukachevo. I’d only stay in the border region and not travel deeper into the country.

Before the war, I visited Ukraine around 20 times and have some experience traveling in the region, including Zakarpattia. So I’m not completely unfamiliar, but I still want to make sure it’s currently safe and appropriate to go, given the situation.

Any advice from locals or recent visitors would be very appreciated.

Is this border crossing open for cars? If so, how long is the delay at the border?

I have a passport from The Netherlands (a real cheesehead) in case that's relevant. I did not visit Moldova/Ukraine/Russia before.

Will the travel back a week later be the same at this border?

Alternative, I could fly to Bucharest/Romania, but the the car drive would then be more then 3 hours longer, in that case the border crossing will then be the ferry at Isaccea / Poromna Pereprava.

Please feel free to use this as a template and contact your representatives!","**Find your representatives here:** [**https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative**](https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative)

  
**Subject: Urgent Action Needed to Prevent Trump from Undermining Ukraine and our NATO allies.**

**Dear \[Representative's Name\],**

I am writing to express my deep concern over reports that Donald Trump may attempt to bypass our NATO allies and pressure Ukraine into an unfavorable settlement with Vladimir Putin. Such a maneuver would not only betray our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty—it would corrode U.S. credibility and embolden authoritarian regimes worldwide. The stakes could not be higher.

Ukraine has demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression. Our NATO allies have stood resolute alongside them, affirming the principle that free nations have the right to chart their own destinies without coercion. Any attempt to force Ukraine into a deal on Putin's terms would strike at the heart of democracy, international law, and the collective security architecture the United States helped build and lead.

That is why I urge you to take immediate and decisive action to prevent any unilateral moves—by Trump or anyone else—that might compromise our alliances, appease authoritarianism, or undercut global security. Specifically, I ask you to:

1. **Publicly reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO and to Ukraine’s sovereignty.** It is essential we send a clear, bipartisan message that America keeps its word—and stands with those who defend freedom.
2. **Support legislation that strengthens congressional oversight of foreign policy,** preventing any administration from bypassing allies or making backroom deals that endanger global stability.
3. **Advocate for sustained and expanded military and economic aid to Ukraine,** including lifting any remaining restrictions on the delivery of long-range weapons systems. Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength—not while one hand is tied behind its back.
4. **Impose new, robust sanctions on Russia,** targeting sectors that continue to bankroll its war machine and signaling that aggression will be met with escalating consequences, not diplomatic reward.
5. **Champion legislation that protects Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers,** particularly in light of Trump’s radical anti-immigration agenda. No one fleeing Putin’s war should be subjected to deportation or bureaucratic purgatory in the United States.

The American people overwhelmingly support Ukraine’s fight for freedom. We cannot allow political expediency or authoritarian nostalgia to erode that support. History is watching—and the cost of appeasement is always paid in blood.

Thank you for your leadership and commitment to democratic values. I look forward to your response and to seeing bold, principled action on this issue.

**Sincerely,**

ukraine,I’m worried for my Ukrainian friend who is scared she’ll have to return to the Ukraine and leave the UK,"hello, 
I’m not Ukrainian but my friend is. I’m not sure this is the right sub for this topic but I didn’t have a lot of luck in the UK subs (due to anti immigration views taking over reddit), so if you think this is the wrong sub Id appreciate direction on where to post this.

I have a colleague who has become a good friend of mine who is struggling right now with her immigration status in the UK. 
She is Ukrainian, from West Ukraine (not sure where exactly right now but can provide this info at a later time when I asked her). She came here 3 years ago via the Ukraine Scheme when her area in Ukraine was deemed as risky. She has a good and secure job here now, a partner and a life. 

About 6 months ago she was excited because she received the news that this kind of refugee visa has been extended for another 2 years after her expiry date which is July 2025.

However, recently she told me that news broke of changes within the scheme which wouldn’t grant her an automatic 2 year extension. She’d now have to apply for it to be extended for another 1.5 years, and that is if she will even be accepted for extension. The area she is from has been deemed as “non risk” by UK immigration. Which is not true for the actual residents living in her city, as her sister is still there with currently no electricity in a really harsh winter.

I am worried for her to be sent back to the Ukraine as it is simply not safe, despite what immigration says. She built up a life here and has made use of her time here. It’s so unfair.

After she told me about all of this, we discussed her options. She is currently working in a good position within the hospitality industry with a good salary. However, this job would not qualify for a working visa. Our boss likes her and said he could apply to be her sponsor so she could get the working visa, although this is a long and expensive process which in the end could all be for nothing if it was rejected in the end. 

She was thinking of going to University to get a student visa and then go the legal work visa route to stay in the UK, but that wouldn’t be possible if she will be refused for an extension on her current status as she needs the time to make all this happen.

She is going to apply for the 1,5-year-extension this summer however she’s worried as she read that many Ukrainians have been refused. a friend of hers from the same region has been accepted for the extension. the friend doesn’t speak english and we are unsure what are the requirements to be accepted for it. 

Has anybody dealt with similar when looking for refuge? how are you guys dealing with this and if there are any Ukrainians in the UK here, what would be her best course of action in this? I really want her to stay in the UK. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1kp2cmp/im_worried_for_my_ukrainian_friend_who_is_scared/,2025-05-17 22:21:53,immigrantUkrainian refugee,36
ukraine,The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace,"I found this useful for understanding my own biases, and I think it could be very useful when discussing the war with liberal minded folk like myself. I've run it through an AI translator that I think did an excellent job.

Original: [https://trafo.hypotheses.org/52570](https://trafo.hypotheses.org/52570)

The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace

  


  


By Olena Komar

  


In this article, I demonstrate a series of biases against Ukrainians in Western countries, which I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome” (by analogy with the “North African syndrome”). These prejudices have emerged due to how Ukrainians speak about the war and how they are perceived in connection with Western European stereotypical expectations. Furthermore, these prejudices have a colonial nature, stemming from an inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians. This bias is reinforced by historical short-sightedness, influenced by pro-Russian sentiment in Slavic studies as well as by pseudo-pacifism.

  


Pseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence but also to shift the blame onto the victims—denying them the right to self-determination and the capacity to make informed decisions about their fate. These prejudices are also a form of epistemic injustice, which must be confronted by rooting out ignorance. Such ignorance can be intentional, serving the interests of the oppressor by sustaining misunderstanding of the experience and suffering of the oppressed.

  


There are several levels of epistemic injustice:

  


1. Stereotyping Ukrainians’ struggle for survival and identity as a manifestation of belligerence;
2. Rejection of war as a negative phenomenon is projected onto war victims—their experiences and emotions become unwanted. This leads to silencing or victimization;
3. Injustice of testimony and gaslighting result from “blind spots” in people’s knowledge: a distrust of Ukrainians’ accounts and understanding of their own history and of Russians;
4. Unjust equalization, coercion into peace and compromises that benefit only the aggressor.

  


  


  


Negativity or Resistance to Oppression?

  


  


A Ukrainian athlete refused to shake hands with a Russian athlete, Ukrainian writers declined to participate in a joint panel discussion with a Russian writer, and Ukrainian scholars protested against the idea of delegates from Russian universities participating in a conference.

  


How do Western Europeans react to such news? Do they view these actions as legitimate, just, reasonable? Most often, such events escalate into scandals, and the Ukrainians involved are accused of xenophobia, racism, or nationalism, cruelty, aggression, and discrimination, because Ukrainians distrust talk about peace negotiations, refuse to build “bridges of friendship” between intellectuals, and their statements are interpreted as hate speech.

  


Is there something wrong with the Ukrainians themselves and how they deliver their messages? Or is the problem on the side of the listeners, in how they perceive these messages and their trust in the speakers? I want to draw attention here to the latter.

  


The stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied plays into the hands of Russian propaganda, which tries to portray Ukrainians as simply “bad Russians.” In my opinion, without a proper understanding of hermeneutical injustice, the harm caused is likely to grow—reinforcing the formation of what I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”

  


  


What Are the Preconditions for This Argument, and Where Does the Term Come From?

  


  


I use this term by analogy with the one used by Frantz Fanon, who introduced the “North African Syndrome” in his essay of the same name. This is not a medical diagnosis but a prejudice held by French psychiatrists toward North African inhabitants. Modern science recognizes this syndrome as a manifestation of racist colonial bias—under which North Africans were seen as lazy or overly emotional.

  


This viewpoint did not necessarily stem from malice on the part of individual doctors, but rather from stereotypical perceptions of Africans as mentally inferior and emotionally unstable—perceptions shaped by colonial attitudes. This bias arose unconsciously as a result of institutional instruction—but does that absolve the doctors from responsibility for their own ignorance?

  


Modern science considers such ignorance blameworthy and irresponsible because, first, it could have been avoided and corrected through proper epistemic conduct, and second, it harms others and therefore is not innocent.

  


Many studies have been devoted to decolonizing knowledge and to the concept of “white optics” or “white ignorance,” which allows one to “not see” numerous discriminatory manifestations.

  


And yet there is still no clear understanding of the place of white Slavic peoples in Europe, who for much of the last few centuries have been more oppressed than oppressors.

  


  


The Lack of a Hermeneutical Perspective Toward Ukrainians

  


  


The absence of a hermeneutical perspective regarding Ukrainians as Eastern Europeans who, for most of their history, were enslaved, restricted in rights, oppressed, or engaged in struggles against attempts at genocidal extermination has extremely harmful consequences for understanding the present-day Ukrainian condition.

  


Imposing a Western European optic onto Ukrainians leads to dramatic distortions because Ukrainians historically have been neither a privileged part of the Western world with its colonialism, nor do they identify with the “Russian world” and its imperial ambitions.

  


Anti-colonial and anti-racist criticism also often misses the mark, since Ukrainians are not “white privileged oppressors.” Therefore, accusations of racism for helping Ukrainian refugees—which are often inflamed by Russian propaganda abroad—are deliberately divisive messages.

  


At the same time, Ukrainians have never been perceived by the West as a distinct oppressed community, because they were viewed only through the Russian colonial optic as “the edge of Russia” or as “Little Russians.” This was reinforced by both the Soviet myth of the equality of brotherly republics and the Russian myth of the “younger brother.” The current rhetoric of the Russian regime toward Ukrainians is even worse, consisting of the total denial of Ukrainian subjectivity—as “bad Russians” or even as a “virus.”

  


As a result, Ukrainian identity is extremely blurred in the Western European focus, and in many aspects—including language—there is a blind spot. For example, refugee assistance centers abroad default to offering help from Russian-speaking interpreters. This has led to Ukrainians becoming invisible and unheard in their uniqueness, and being perceived with prejudice or mistrust, while their epistemic status has been downgraded.

  


Since many Europeans are only now encountering Ukrainians personally for the first time, they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions. This may give the impression that most Ukrainians are dissatisfied, negative, belligerent, and intolerant. But today’s image of Ukrainians is being shaped by the extraordinary circumstances of resisting an invasion—and by the world’s inadequate response to it—not by any “natural state” of Ukrainians themselves.

  


  


Bravery or Belligerence?

  


  


At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, social media and lightboxes in European, U.S., and Canadian cities were flooded with the slogan: “Be brave like Ukraine.” The world was amazed by the courage with which Ukrainians resisted an enemy whose territory is over 28 times larger, whose population is five times greater, and whose military is the “second-largest army in the world,” equipped with nuclear weapons.

  


Yet even this slogan faced criticism, with some saying it “normalizes” and “encourages” continuation of the war—something Europeans hoped never to see again. It’s easy to ignore a war in the center of Europe: just close your eyes to the Ukrainians who have brought their misfortune with them—or blame them for what’s happening.

ukraine,Looking forward - would love to hear ppl's thoughts on eventual reconstruction,"Sorry for the vague question, but I only have a vague understanding. Appreciate any input!

I started following Ukraine/Euro news at the start of the war and I'm looking for others' thoughts to deepen my admittedly simplistic view. Would also love accessible resources (podcasts, YT) that go into this regularly. I mostly rely on the Times radio show which is more present/retrospective, not future-oriented.

From everything I've seen it looks like Ukraine is could be poised to become the next Poland, socially/economically once Russia collapses (god willing). Obviously there are big challenges (population decline, corruption, etc.) but I'm saying the potential is there.

My thinking is like this:

Europe knows Ukraine is its best defense against future Russian activity, so it's reasonable to expect extensive aid incoming. The war (in my understanding) has already done a lot to bring Ukraine closer to western Europe in terms of tech, culture, and training. The gov. has been working closely with EU monitors to bring their legal code/corruption standards up to par.

The Ukrainian ppl themselves are unified in a way most countries never experience - they've been actively fighting against Russian influence for more than a decade at this point. I know there's a lot of internal bickering but on the big issues it seems like everyone is on the same page.

Foreign investors would love comparatively cheap, educated labor as long as they felt secure there. And I feel like Ukraine has a strong understanding of western business culture, and the ppl are educated and tech-savvy. The returning refugees also have the potential to bring additional connections, etc. 

**So what might be some serious or interesting challenges? Opportunities?**

For example, I recently learned that a lot of the farm land is in some kind of legal limbo due to soviet-era collective ownership. Sorting that out alone seems like both a huge hurdle and opportunity.

Would really love to hear any thoughts. And if I'm mistaken/dumb, please correct me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1kv8pul/looking_forward_would_love_to_hear_ppls_thoughts/,2025-05-25 19:56:51,refugee in Europe,12
ukraine,Considering coming for aid work. Warned about racism - is it real/dangerous?,"Hey, am an Indian-American doctor.

Considering spending some months in Eastern Ukraine for medical aid work. Am clear that it is ofc dangerous at baseline. But after speaking to a couple ppl with experience in foreign aid work, tho not specifically in Ukraine, I was warned that I may face additional hardship/danger due to racism. The organization I plan to work with does not believe this will be a significant issue.

Figured I'd try to get a wider perspective. Are sentiments against indians/brown people significantly negative? Will I be directly treated worse because of it/will it lead to conflict with patients?

While dealing with general racism just comes with the job to some extent, I am concerned as racism in a warzone carries more serious risks than some asshole mouthing off in the ER.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1m5td6a/considering_coming_for_aid_work_warned_about/,2025-07-21 22:03:26,eastern Ukraine,39

The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace

  


  


By Olena Komar

  


In this article, I demonstrate a series of biases against Ukrainians in Western countries, which I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome” (by analogy with the “North African syndrome”). These prejudices have emerged due to how Ukrainians speak about the war and how they are perceived in connection with Western European stereotypical expectations. Furthermore, these prejudices have a colonial nature, stemming from an inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians. This bias is reinforced by historical short-sightedness, influenced by pro-Russian sentiment in Slavic studies as well as by pseudo-pacifism.

  


Pseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence but also to shift the blame onto the victims—denying them the right to self-determination and the capacity to make informed decisions about their fate. These prejudices are also a form of epistemic injustice, which must be confronted by rooting out ignorance. Such ignorance can be intentional, serving the interests of the oppressor by sustaining misunderstanding of the experience and suffering of the oppressed.

  


There are several levels of epistemic injustice:

  


1. Stereotyping Ukrainians’ struggle for survival and identity as a manifestation of belligerence;
2. Rejection of war as a negative phenomenon is projected onto war victims—their experiences and emotions become unwanted. This leads to silencing or victimization;
3. Injustice of testimony and gaslighting result from “blind spots” in people’s knowledge: a distrust of Ukrainians’ accounts and understanding of their own history and of Russians;
4. Unjust equalization, coercion into peace and compromises that benefit only the aggressor.

  


  


  


Negativity or Resistance to Oppression?

  


  


A Ukrainian athlete refused to shake hands with a Russian athlete, Ukrainian writers declined to participate in a joint panel discussion with a Russian writer, and Ukrainian scholars protested against the idea of delegates from Russian universities participating in a conference.

  


How do Western Europeans react to such news? Do they view these actions as legitimate, just, reasonable? Most often, such events escalate into scandals, and the Ukrainians involved are accused of xenophobia, racism, or nationalism, cruelty, aggression, and discrimination, because Ukrainians distrust talk about peace negotiations, refuse to build “bridges of friendship” between intellectuals, and their statements are interpreted as hate speech.

  


Is there something wrong with the Ukrainians themselves and how they deliver their messages? Or is the problem on the side of the listeners, in how they perceive these messages and their trust in the speakers? I want to draw attention here to the latter.

  


The stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied plays into the hands of Russian propaganda, which tries to portray Ukrainians as simply “bad Russians.” In my opinion, without a proper understanding of hermeneutical injustice, the harm caused is likely to grow—reinforcing the formation of what I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”

  


  


What Are the Preconditions for This Argument, and Where Does the Term Come From?

  


  


I use this term by analogy with the one used by Frantz Fanon, who introduced the “North African Syndrome” in his essay of the same name. This is not a medical diagnosis but a prejudice held by French psychiatrists toward North African inhabitants. Modern science recognizes this syndrome as a manifestation of racist colonial bias—under which North Africans were seen as lazy or overly emotional.

  


This viewpoint did not necessarily stem from malice on the part of individual doctors, but rather from stereotypical perceptions of Africans as mentally inferior and emotionally unstable—perceptions shaped by colonial attitudes. This bias arose unconsciously as a result of institutional instruction—but does that absolve the doctors from responsibility for their own ignorance?

  


Modern science considers such ignorance blameworthy and irresponsible because, first, it could have been avoided and corrected through proper epistemic conduct, and second, it harms others and therefore is not innocent.

  


Many studies have been devoted to decolonizing knowledge and to the concept of “white optics” or “white ignorance,” which allows one to “not see” numerous discriminatory manifestations.

  


And yet there is still no clear understanding of the place of white Slavic peoples in Europe, who for much of the last few centuries have been more oppressed than oppressors.

  


  


The Lack of a Hermeneutical Perspective Toward Ukrainians

  


  


The absence of a hermeneutical perspective regarding Ukrainians as Eastern Europeans who, for most of their history, were enslaved, restricted in rights, oppressed, or engaged in struggles against attempts at genocidal extermination has extremely harmful consequences for understanding the present-day Ukrainian condition.

  


Imposing a Western European optic onto Ukrainians leads to dramatic distortions because Ukrainians historically have been neither a privileged part of the Western world with its colonialism, nor do they identify with the “Russian world” and its imperial ambitions.

  


Anti-colonial and anti-racist criticism also often misses the mark, since Ukrainians are not “white privileged oppressors.” Therefore, accusations of racism for helping Ukrainian refugees—which are often inflamed by Russian propaganda abroad—are deliberately divisive messages.

  


At the same time, Ukrainians have never been perceived by the West as a distinct oppressed community, because they were viewed only through the Russian colonial optic as “the edge of Russia” or as “Little Russians.” This was reinforced by both the Soviet myth of the equality of brotherly republics and the Russian myth of the “younger brother.” The current rhetoric of the Russian regime toward Ukrainians is even worse, consisting of the total denial of Ukrainian subjectivity—as “bad Russians” or even as a “virus.”

  


As a result, Ukrainian identity is extremely blurred in the Western European focus, and in many aspects—including language—there is a blind spot. For example, refugee assistance centers abroad default to offering help from Russian-speaking interpreters. This has led to Ukrainians becoming invisible and unheard in their uniqueness, and being perceived with prejudice or mistrust, while their epistemic status has been downgraded.

  


Since many Europeans are only now encountering Ukrainians personally for the first time, they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions. This may give the impression that most Ukrainians are dissatisfied, negative, belligerent, and intolerant. But today’s image of Ukrainians is being shaped by the extraordinary circumstances of resisting an invasion—and by the world’s inadequate response to it—not by any “natural state” of Ukrainians themselves.

  


  


Bravery or Belligerence?

  


  


At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, social media and lightboxes in European, U.S., and Canadian cities were flooded with the slogan: “Be brave like Ukraine.” The world was amazed by the courage with which Ukrainians resisted an enemy whose territory is over 28 times larger, whose population is five times greater, and whose military is the “second-largest army in the world,” equipped with nuclear weapons.

  


Yet even this slogan faced criticism, with some saying it “normalizes” and “encourages” continuation of the war—something Europeans hoped never to see again. It’s easy to ignore a war in the center of Europe: just close your eyes to the Ukrainians who have brought their misfortune with them—or blame them for what’s happening.

  


  


A Personal Anecdote

  


  


“My son, age 10, visibly tenses when I suggest adding a slide with a photo of the destroyed museum to his school presentation in Vienna about the Ukrainian artist Mariia Prymachenko. On February 25, 2022, the museum in the town of Ivankiv, which housed a collection of the artist’s paintings, was destroyed by the Russian army during their advance on Kyiv.

  


Of course, Austrian teachers and students will love Prymachenko’s fantastical animals, birds, and flowers—works admired by Pablo Picasso. They are colorful and joyful. But why should they see that the artist’s museum was destroyed by Russian soldiers? They might not even like that you mention “Russian”—there’s a Russian student in class, it might make him uncomfortable, and that could be labeled as ‘xenophobia.’”

  


Even a young child in primary school quickly learns that Ukrainians with “their war” do not fit the standards of pacifist countries—especially German-speaking ones.

  


Are our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation.





  


European Pacifism and the Rejection of Ukrainian Pain

  


  


The pacifism of modern Germans and Austrians—their rejection of nationalism and aggression in any form—has a clear historical basis: a desire to forget and cleanse themselves after World War II from the image of a nation burdened with collective guilt for Nazi crimes or, at the very least, for their failure to resist evil.

  


Those who, more than anyone, should understand what Ukrainians feel today—once again victims of aggression—prefer not to reopen wounds of memory, even if that means ignoring the destruction of Ukrainians.

  


But there is a huge difference between renouncing the idea of attacking other countries and denying others their right to defend themselves by any means available when they are attacked.

  


  


“Kriegmüde” – War-Weary

  


  


“Kriegmüde” (literally “tired of war”) is a new German word I learned from a letter from another school. Europeans are tired of the war, of high prices, of helping refugees, and they ask us: “When will there be peace? Why don’t Ukrainians compromise?”

  


But can Ukrainians afford to be tired of the war? Do they keep talking about it because they want it to continue?

  


Si vis pacem, para bellum — “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Peace will come through justice, not through compromise if that compromise is rotten.

  


According to Professor Margalit, author of On Compromise and Rotten Compromises, those compromises that preserve a regime of cruelty and humiliation are morally unacceptable—even in the name of peace.

  


  


This Isn’t the First Time the West Has Looked Away

  


  


This is not the first time in world history that Western Europeans have not wanted to know about the destruction of Ukrainians by Russians.

  


At present, “peace” for Ukraine on Russian terms means slow, systematic extermination, as has happened in previous periods of history. In his 1983 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe, Czech writer Milan Kundera—himself exiled because of Soviet aggression—criticized Western Europeans for not valuing what other Europeans were ready to die for.

  


He wrote:

  


“One of the great European peoples (almost forty million Ukrainians) is slowly disappearing. And this immense, nearly unbelievable event is taking place, and the world does not notice it.”

  


  


  


  


Allies Stabbing in the Back

  


  


Ukrainians are genuinely angered and frustrated by a number of topics related to false or misguided support from allies—especially when these same allies simultaneously express support for supposedly “good Russians” or try to build “bridges of friendship” with them.

  


Since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, many Western institutions—including universities and academies—have issued public statements that repeat the phrase:

  


“We support Ukrainians and brave Russians who oppose the war.”

  


But this seemingly inclusive language is deeply flawed. First, it equates the aggressor and the victim. Second, it places the virtue label “brave” on Russians, while Ukrainians are merely pitied as victims. Third, it often borrows Ukrainian symbols to promote Russian Studies, which many Ukrainians perceive as an act of appropriation.

  


Even if well-intentioned, these gestures often backfire. Ukrainians feel betrayed, silenced, or spoken over. This is a form of gaslighting—and as scholar Rachel McKinnon explains, betrayal by an ally hurts especially deeply. It is compounded by “westsplaining” and “russsplaining”: imposing Western or Russian colonial views on Ukrainians, who are framed through Russian-dominated academic lenses.

  


  


  


  


False Equivalence and Real Injustice

  


  


A disturbing example: the Finnish Migration Service housed Russian men avoiding mobilization in the same shelters as Ukrainian refugee women and children. This was traumatic and dangerous for the Ukrainian women—but it stemmed from an epistemic blind spot, a refusal to differentiate between the oppressed and the complicit.

  


This kind of moral flattening continues in many forms:

  


* Demanding Ukrainian victims engage in panels with “brave Russians”
* Framing the war as a “family conflict”
* Calling for equal dialogue between an aggressor and their victim

  


  


Such gestures are not neutral. They entrench injustice. Real justice means amplifying Ukrainian voices, prioritizing the needs of the oppressed, and resisting narratives that “both-sides” the war.

  


  


  


  


What Real Parity Requires

  


  


Equal negotiations cannot occur until:

  


1. Full cessation of aggression and guarantees against future attacks
2. Compensation for historical discrimination
3. Transformation of social structures to eliminate injustice
4. Affirmative support for the voices of the historically oppressed

  


  


Only then can genuine parity be discussed. Otherwise, reconciliation efforts only entrench discrimination and deepen epistemic injustice.

  


  


  


  


Conclusion

  


  


The literature on decolonizing knowledge and epistemic injustice is relatively new. Yet Ukraine remains almost a tabula rasa in that discourse.

  


Western Europe faces a historic choice:

Either to finally discover the real Ukraine—

or to unwittingly assist Russian propaganda in cultivating the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”

* No changes here.

**Events this week:**

* Ukraine used FPV drones launched from trucks driven by unwitting Russians against 5 different Russian airbases thousands of miles away from each other. This attack marks a new epoch in military history. Ukraine claims to have destroyed and damaged over 40 aircraft, including priceless, irreplaceable Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers which Russia no longer has the ability to produce. So far satellite imagery has confirmed the destruction of at least 19 aircraft. There are many historic aspects of this attack, but one of the most significant is that this is the first time in history that a significant part of a nation's nuclear triad has been destroyed. This changes the game in term of Russia's nuclear deterrence on a global strategic level, as well as on the strategic level within Ukraine. While I've seen some legitimate questions about whether or not some of the planes destroyed were not being actively used, the fact that, as you can see in the video, the planes were fueled and went up in flames, at least some of them were being staged for a massive cruise missile attack that was due to begin on June 1st and has now been called off. I also want to highlight that two A-50 recon planes were also destroyed or heavily damaged in this attack, Russia only has a couple of those planes left now, and they are incredibly important for Russia's ability to see the entire battlefield.
* Ukrainian special forces also detonated some kind of bomb under the Kerch straight bridge between Crimea and Russia. It's unclear how much damage was done to the bridge, but Russia claims traffic has already resumed, though they may be lying.
* Trump then spoke on the phone with Putin and said on social media that Putin said he would retaliate, even as he gave zero indication that he had pushed back in any way on this.
* Ukrainian forces claimed that for the first time they were able to destroy a Russian Iskander ballistic missile system. Russia uses these systems to strike Ukraine constantly, including an attack last week that killed 12 Ukrainian soldiers and injured 60 more. While the loss of one system is not necessarily a huge blow, these systems are kept deep behind the lines, so it's great that Ukraine has found a way to find and attack them.
* House speaker Mike Johnson came out publicly in support of tough sanctions on Russia and said there was strong support in Congress for such a bill. Even as Trump completely abdicates any role he might play in bringing this bill up, there is such a strong desire in Congress for hurting Russia that this might happen without him.
* Many different European nations have announced different big aid packages for Ukraine, with many of them focusing on providing funding for weapons production within Ukraine. Ukraine is also in talks with the US to use some of this money to buy American weapons under the terms of the minerals deal that was signed.
* Russian casualties are nearing the awful milestone of 1 million, with likely 250,000 of these casualties being deaths, while the others are injured. This is a truly stunning number. Ukrainian casualties meanwhile are likely around 400,000, with just under 100,000 of these being deaths.

**Oryx Numbers:**

* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,045 (+77)
* Russian tank losses: 4,037 (+8)
* Russian IFV losses: 6,011 (+14)
* Russian SPG losses: 945 (+3)
* Russian SAM losses: 334 (+2)
* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)
* Russian Aircraft losses: 155 (+14)
* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+0)
* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,067 (+50)
* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,195 (+1)
* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,385 (+9)
* Ukrainian IMV losses: 958 (+9)
* Ukrainian SPG losses: 566 (+5)
* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)

Light losses on both sides, with the obvious caveat that Russia lost more aircraft confirmed on Oryx this week than at any time in the entire course of the war. In total during the war, Ukraine has now destroyed 11 Tu-22s, 8 Tu-95s, and 2 A-50s. Russia started with 57 Tu-22s, 55 Tu-95, and between 6 and 8 A-50s, so those are all significant percentages of the fleets, especially when you consider that even many active planes might not necessarily be operable.

We are aware of all risks, but we are prepared to under go  them. Our plan is to go by car, spend 1-2 days in Lviv, then travel to Kyiv, where we want to be 3-4 days. We would like to see more, but we aren't sure where we can get, without causing problems for Ukraine and its defenders. 

Could you please give us a hand? Some general info on how to have ""tourist trip"" to Ukraine  in this time, what to do, and what not? Maybe even some tips where to go and what to visit. We are not afraid to visit even the eastern Ukraine, in fact, we would really wanted to, but as i stated before, we don't want to cause trouble for Ukraine and its defenders. We would also gladly brought some gifts, but as two poor students, I am not sure if we will be able to buy more than few bandages or few food cans. Any idea what would help, even in small amount?

ukraine,First ever translation of Ukrainian classic novella,"Greetings subscribers of r/Ukraine! First, I would like to thank all those of you who support Ukraine, whether by donating, informing people or simply by engaging with Ukrainian culture, which has historically been seriously repressed. In today's time, however, Ukrainian culture, like its literature, is still relatively unknown. The major writers, like Shevchenko, and certain major literary works are available in other languages, but the majority of Ukrainian classics still remain untranslated. This is why I took it upon myself to change that. Very soon I will be releasing a translated version of a Ukrainian novella written around 1887 by Olha Kobylianska. Her work has a deeply lyrical aspect, with emotive descriptions of people's feelings and beautiful descriptions of nature. Her work generally deals with questions of women's rights, individualism and conformity. Upon reading the book for the first time, I was surprised at how fresh it felt, despite being quite old. In addition to her literary work, she also began women's education and empowerment groups in her region of Ukraine, and she was one of the first feminist authors and activists of Eastern Europe. I found it rather disheartening that out of all her books, barely any have been translated into English, and the ones that were are long out of print. By releasing this book, I want to show the world that Ukrainian literature has a lot to offer readers all around the world, despite being relatively unknown. Additionally, the existence of Ukrainian literature as a real, tangible and worthwhile concept disproves the harmful and disingenuous idea of Ukraine not having a unique, individual cultural identity which has been forming for centuries. In the future, I plan on growing this project, since there is no shortage of books to translate, and I will be adding many other authors to the collection. If any of you have any questions, I’ll happily answer them, and I would greatly appreciate anybody purchasing the book, or even just spreading awareness. I’m sure you won’t be disappointed! Additionally, since I plan on advancing the project, I would be happy to consider offers of collaboration or anything similar.

ukraine,Volunteering in civilian roles,"Hi,

I’m an American. When the war broke out, I was doing my bachelor’s in Vilnius, and knew immediately that I had to do my part to help Ukraine. I became a teacher, teaching English to some of the thousands of Ukrainian refugees who came into Lithuania. Now though, I’ve graduated and don’t have much to do, and most of all, don’t feel like I have a purpose.

I am desperately searching for meaningful work, and the most meaningful work I’ve done to date has been the aforementioned teaching job, helping Ukrainians. This is a theme I want to continue, and as directly as possible—in Ukraine itself if necessary. 

My question therefore is if there are civilian military support roles I could fill in Ukraine, as a volunteer. I don’t have any military experience, but I’m a pretty capable person when it comes to clerical work, teaching, writing, research, or outreach. Really, I’m open to anything.

The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace

  


  


By Olena Komar

  


In this article, I demonstrate a series of biases against Ukrainians in Western countries, which I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome” (by analogy with the “North African syndrome”). These prejudices have emerged due to how Ukrainians speak about the war and how they are perceived in connection with Western European stereotypical expectations. Furthermore, these prejudices have a colonial nature, stemming from an inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians. This bias is reinforced by historical short-sightedness, influenced by pro-Russian sentiment in Slavic studies as well as by pseudo-pacifism.

  


Pseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence but also to shift the blame onto the victims—denying them the right to self-determination and the capacity to make informed decisions about their fate. These prejudices are also a form of epistemic injustice, which must be confronted by rooting out ignorance. Such ignorance can be intentional, serving the interests of the oppressor by sustaining misunderstanding of the experience and suffering of the oppressed.

  


There are several levels of epistemic injustice:

  


1. Stereotyping Ukrainians’ struggle for survival and identity as a manifestation of belligerence;
2. Rejection of war as a negative phenomenon is projected onto war victims—their experiences and emotions become unwanted. This leads to silencing or victimization;
3. Injustice of testimony and gaslighting result from “blind spots” in people’s knowledge: a distrust of Ukrainians’ accounts and understanding of their own history and of Russians;
4. Unjust equalization, coercion into peace and compromises that benefit only the aggressor.

  


  


  


Negativity or Resistance to Oppression?

  


  


A Ukrainian athlete refused to shake hands with a Russian athlete, Ukrainian writers declined to participate in a joint panel discussion with a Russian writer, and Ukrainian scholars protested against the idea of delegates from Russian universities participating in a conference.

  


How do Western Europeans react to such news? Do they view these actions as legitimate, just, reasonable? Most often, such events escalate into scandals, and the Ukrainians involved are accused of xenophobia, racism, or nationalism, cruelty, aggression, and discrimination, because Ukrainians distrust talk about peace negotiations, refuse to build “bridges of friendship” between intellectuals, and their statements are interpreted as hate speech.

  


Is there something wrong with the Ukrainians themselves and how they deliver their messages? Or is the problem on the side of the listeners, in how they perceive these messages and their trust in the speakers? I want to draw attention here to the latter.

  


The stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied plays into the hands of Russian propaganda, which tries to portray Ukrainians as simply “bad Russians.” In my opinion, without a proper understanding of hermeneutical injustice, the harm caused is likely to grow—reinforcing the formation of what I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”

  


  


What Are the Preconditions for This Argument, and Where Does the Term Come From?

  


  


I use this term by analogy with the one used by Frantz Fanon, who introduced the “North African Syndrome” in his essay of the same name. This is not a medical diagnosis but a prejudice held by French psychiatrists toward North African inhabitants. Modern science recognizes this syndrome as a manifestation of racist colonial bias—under which North Africans were seen as lazy or overly emotional.

  


This viewpoint did not necessarily stem from malice on the part of individual doctors, but rather from stereotypical perceptions of Africans as mentally inferior and emotionally unstable—perceptions shaped by colonial attitudes. This bias arose unconsciously as a result of institutional instruction—but does that absolve the doctors from responsibility for their own ignorance?

  


Modern science considers such ignorance blameworthy and irresponsible because, first, it could have been avoided and corrected through proper epistemic conduct, and second, it harms others and therefore is not innocent.

  


Many studies have been devoted to decolonizing knowledge and to the concept of “white optics” or “white ignorance,” which allows one to “not see” numerous discriminatory manifestations.

  


And yet there is still no clear understanding of the place of white Slavic peoples in Europe, who for much of the last few centuries have been more oppressed than oppressors.

  


  


The Lack of a Hermeneutical Perspective Toward Ukrainians

  


  


The absence of a hermeneutical perspective regarding Ukrainians as Eastern Europeans who, for most of their history, were enslaved, restricted in rights, oppressed, or engaged in struggles against attempts at genocidal extermination has extremely harmful consequences for understanding the present-day Ukrainian condition.

  


Imposing a Western European optic onto Ukrainians leads to dramatic distortions because Ukrainians historically have been neither a privileged part of the Western world with its colonialism, nor do they identify with the “Russian world” and its imperial ambitions.

  


Anti-colonial and anti-racist criticism also often misses the mark, since Ukrainians are not “white privileged oppressors.” Therefore, accusations of racism for helping Ukrainian refugees—which are often inflamed by Russian propaganda abroad—are deliberately divisive messages.

  


At the same time, Ukrainians have never been perceived by the West as a distinct oppressed community, because they were viewed only through the Russian colonial optic as “the edge of Russia” or as “Little Russians.” This was reinforced by both the Soviet myth of the equality of brotherly republics and the Russian myth of the “younger brother.” The current rhetoric of the Russian regime toward Ukrainians is even worse, consisting of the total denial of Ukrainian subjectivity—as “bad Russians” or even as a “virus.”

  


As a result, Ukrainian identity is extremely blurred in the Western European focus, and in many aspects—including language—there is a blind spot. For example, refugee assistance centers abroad default to offering help from Russian-speaking interpreters. This has led to Ukrainians becoming invisible and unheard in their uniqueness, and being perceived with prejudice or mistrust, while their epistemic status has been downgraded.

  


Since many Europeans are only now encountering Ukrainians personally for the first time, they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions. This may give the impression that most Ukrainians are dissatisfied, negative, belligerent, and intolerant. But today’s image of Ukrainians is being shaped by the extraordinary circumstances of resisting an invasion—and by the world’s inadequate response to it—not by any “natural state” of Ukrainians themselves.

  


  


Bravery or Belligerence?

  


  


At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, social media and lightboxes in European, U.S., and Canadian cities were flooded with the slogan: “Be brave like Ukraine.” The world was amazed by the courage with which Ukrainians resisted an enemy whose territory is over 28 times larger, whose population is five times greater, and whose military is the “second-largest army in the world,” equipped with nuclear weapons.

  


Yet even this slogan faced criticism, with some saying it “normalizes” and “encourages” continuation of the war—something Europeans hoped never to see again. It’s easy to ignore a war in the center of Europe: just close your eyes to the Ukrainians who have brought their misfortune with them—or blame them for what’s happening.

  


  


A Personal Anecdote

  


  


“My son, age 10, visibly tenses when I suggest adding a slide with a photo of the destroyed museum to his school presentation in Vienna about the Ukrainian artist Mariia Prymachenko. On February 25, 2022, the museum in the town of Ivankiv, which housed a collection of the artist’s paintings, was destroyed by the Russian army during their advance on Kyiv.

  


Of course, Austrian teachers and students will love Prymachenko’s fantastical animals, birds, and flowers—works admired by Pablo Picasso. They are colorful and joyful. But why should they see that the artist’s museum was destroyed by Russian soldiers? They might not even like that you mention “Russian”—there’s a Russian student in class, it might make him uncomfortable, and that could be labeled as ‘xenophobia.’”

  


Even a young child in primary school quickly learns that Ukrainians with “their war” do not fit the standards of pacifist countries—especially German-speaking ones.

  


Are our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation.





  


European Pacifism and the Rejection of Ukrainian Pain

  


  


The pacifism of modern Germans and Austrians—their rejection of nationalism and aggression in any form—has a clear historical basis: a desire to forget and cleanse themselves after World War II from the image of a nation burdened with collective guilt for Nazi crimes or, at the very least, for their failure to resist evil.

  


Those who, more than anyone, should understand what Ukrainians feel today—once again victims of aggression—prefer not to reopen wounds of memory, even if that means ignoring the destruction of Ukrainians.

  


But there is a huge difference between renouncing the idea of attacking other countries and denying others their right to defend themselves by any means available when they are attacked.

  


  


“Kriegmüde” – War-Weary

  


  


“Kriegmüde” (literally “tired of war”) is a new German word I learned from a letter from another school. Europeans are tired of the war, of high prices, of helping refugees, and they ask us: “When will there be peace? Why don’t Ukrainians compromise?”

  


But can Ukrainians afford to be tired of the war? Do they keep talking about it because they want it to continue?

  


Si vis pacem, para bellum — “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Peace will come through justice, not through compromise if that compromise is rotten.

  


According to Professor Margalit, author of On Compromise and Rotten Compromises, those compromises that preserve a regime of cruelty and humiliation are morally unacceptable—even in the name of peace.

  


  


This Isn’t the First Time the West Has Looked Away

  


  


This is not the first time in world history that Western Europeans have not wanted to know about the destruction of Ukrainians by Russians.

  


At present, “peace” for Ukraine on Russian terms means slow, systematic extermination, as has happened in previous periods of history. In his 1983 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe, Czech writer Milan Kundera—himself exiled because of Soviet aggression—criticized Western Europeans for not valuing what other Europeans were ready to die for.

  


He wrote:

  


“One of the great European peoples (almost forty million Ukrainians) is slowly disappearing. And this immense, nearly unbelievable event is taking place, and the world does not notice it.”

  


  


  


  


Allies Stabbing in the Back

  


  


Ukrainians are genuinely angered and frustrated by a number of topics related to false or misguided support from allies—especially when these same allies simultaneously express support for supposedly “good Russians” or try to build “bridges of friendship” with them.

  


Since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, many Western institutions—including universities and academies—have issued public statements that repeat the phrase:

  


“We support Ukrainians and brave Russians who oppose the war.”

  


But this seemingly inclusive language is deeply flawed. First, it equates the aggressor and the victim. Second, it places the virtue label “brave” on Russians, while Ukrainians are merely pitied as victims. Third, it often borrows Ukrainian symbols to promote Russian Studies, which many Ukrainians perceive as an act of appropriation.

  


Even if well-intentioned, these gestures often backfire. Ukrainians feel betrayed, silenced, or spoken over. This is a form of gaslighting—and as scholar Rachel McKinnon explains, betrayal by an ally hurts especially deeply. It is compounded by “westsplaining” and “russsplaining”: imposing Western or Russian colonial views on Ukrainians, who are framed through Russian-dominated academic lenses.

  


  


  


  


False Equivalence and Real Injustice

  


  


A disturbing example: the Finnish Migration Service housed Russian men avoiding mobilization in the same shelters as Ukrainian refugee women and children. This was traumatic and dangerous for the Ukrainian women—but it stemmed from an epistemic blind spot, a refusal to differentiate between the oppressed and the complicit.

  


This kind of moral flattening continues in many forms:

  


* Demanding Ukrainian victims engage in panels with “brave Russians”
* Framing the war as a “family conflict”
* Calling for equal dialogue between an aggressor and their victim

  


  


Such gestures are not neutral. They entrench injustice. Real justice means amplifying Ukrainian voices, prioritizing the needs of the oppressed, and resisting narratives that “both-sides” the war.

  


  


  


  


What Real Parity Requires

  


  


Equal negotiations cannot occur until:

  


1. Full cessation of aggression and guarantees against future attacks
2. Compensation for historical discrimination
3. Transformation of social structures to eliminate injustice
4. Affirmative support for the voices of the historically oppressed

  


  


Only then can genuine parity be discussed. Otherwise, reconciliation efforts only entrench discrimination and deepen epistemic injustice.

  


  


  


  


Conclusion

  


  


The literature on decolonizing knowledge and epistemic injustice is relatively new. Yet Ukraine remains almost a tabula rasa in that discourse.

  


Western Europe faces a historic choice:

Either to finally discover the real Ukraine—

or to unwittingly assist Russian propaganda in cultivating the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”

Please feel free to use this as a template and contact your representatives!","**Find your representatives here:** [**https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative**](https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative)

  
**Subject: Urgent Action Needed to Prevent Trump from Undermining Ukraine and our NATO allies.**

**Dear \[Representative's Name\],**

I am writing to express my deep concern over reports that Donald Trump may attempt to bypass our NATO allies and pressure Ukraine into an unfavorable settlement with Vladimir Putin. Such a maneuver would not only betray our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty—it would corrode U.S. credibility and embolden authoritarian regimes worldwide. The stakes could not be higher.

Ukraine has demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression. Our NATO allies have stood resolute alongside them, affirming the principle that free nations have the right to chart their own destinies without coercion. Any attempt to force Ukraine into a deal on Putin's terms would strike at the heart of democracy, international law, and the collective security architecture the United States helped build and lead.

That is why I urge you to take immediate and decisive action to prevent any unilateral moves—by Trump or anyone else—that might compromise our alliances, appease authoritarianism, or undercut global security. Specifically, I ask you to:

1. **Publicly reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO and to Ukraine’s sovereignty.** It is essential we send a clear, bipartisan message that America keeps its word—and stands with those who defend freedom.
2. **Support legislation that strengthens congressional oversight of foreign policy,** preventing any administration from bypassing allies or making backroom deals that endanger global stability.
3. **Advocate for sustained and expanded military and economic aid to Ukraine,** including lifting any remaining restrictions on the delivery of long-range weapons systems. Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength—not while one hand is tied behind its back.
4. **Impose new, robust sanctions on Russia,** targeting sectors that continue to bankroll its war machine and signaling that aggression will be met with escalating consequences, not diplomatic reward.
5. **Champion legislation that protects Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers,** particularly in light of Trump’s radical anti-immigration agenda. No one fleeing Putin’s war should be subjected to deportation or bureaucratic purgatory in the United States.

The American people overwhelmingly support Ukraine’s fight for freedom. We cannot allow political expediency or authoritarian nostalgia to erode that support. History is watching—and the cost of appeasement is always paid in blood.

Thank you for your leadership and commitment to democratic values. I look forward to your response and to seeing bold, principled action on this issue.

**Sincerely,**

ukraine,Looking forward - would love to hear ppl's thoughts on eventual reconstruction,"Sorry for the vague question, but I only have a vague understanding. Appreciate any input!

I started following Ukraine/Euro news at the start of the war and I'm looking for others' thoughts to deepen my admittedly simplistic view. Would also love accessible resources (podcasts, YT) that go into this regularly. I mostly rely on the Times radio show which is more present/retrospective, not future-oriented.

From everything I've seen it looks like Ukraine is could be poised to become the next Poland, socially/economically once Russia collapses (god willing). Obviously there are big challenges (population decline, corruption, etc.) but I'm saying the potential is there.

My thinking is like this:

Europe knows Ukraine is its best defense against future Russian activity, so it's reasonable to expect extensive aid incoming. The war (in my understanding) has already done a lot to bring Ukraine closer to western Europe in terms of tech, culture, and training. The gov. has been working closely with EU monitors to bring their legal code/corruption standards up to par.

The Ukrainian ppl themselves are unified in a way most countries never experience - they've been actively fighting against Russian influence for more than a decade at this point. I know there's a lot of internal bickering but on the big issues it seems like everyone is on the same page.

Foreign investors would love comparatively cheap, educated labor as long as they felt secure there. And I feel like Ukraine has a strong understanding of western business culture, and the ppl are educated and tech-savvy. The returning refugees also have the potential to bring additional connections, etc. 

**So what might be some serious or interesting challenges? Opportunities?**

For example, I recently learned that a lot of the farm land is in some kind of legal limbo due to soviet-era collective ownership. Sorting that out alone seems like both a huge hurdle and opportunity.

Would really love to hear any thoughts. And if I'm mistaken/dumb, please correct me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1kv8pul/looking_forward_would_love_to_hear_ppls_thoughts/,2025-05-25 19:56:51,refugee,13
ukraine,I’m worried for my Ukrainian friend who is scared she’ll have to return to the Ukraine and leave the UK,"hello, 
I’m not Ukrainian but my friend is. I’m not sure this is the right sub for this topic but I didn’t have a lot of luck in the UK subs (due to anti immigration views taking over reddit), so if you think this is the wrong sub Id appreciate direction on where to post this.

I have a colleague who has become a good friend of mine who is struggling right now with her immigration status in the UK. 
She is Ukrainian, from West Ukraine (not sure where exactly right now but can provide this info at a later time when I asked her). She came here 3 years ago via the Ukraine Scheme when her area in Ukraine was deemed as risky. She has a good and secure job here now, a partner and a life. 

About 6 months ago she was excited because she received the news that this kind of refugee visa has been extended for another 2 years after her expiry date which is July 2025.

However, recently she told me that news broke of changes within the scheme which wouldn’t grant her an automatic 2 year extension. She’d now have to apply for it to be extended for another 1.5 years, and that is if she will even be accepted for extension. The area she is from has been deemed as “non risk” by UK immigration. Which is not true for the actual residents living in her city, as her sister is still there with currently no electricity in a really harsh winter.

I am worried for her to be sent back to the Ukraine as it is simply not safe, despite what immigration says. She built up a life here and has made use of her time here. It’s so unfair.

After she told me about all of this, we discussed her options. She is currently working in a good position within the hospitality industry with a good salary. However, this job would not qualify for a working visa. Our boss likes her and said he could apply to be her sponsor so she could get the working visa, although this is a long and expensive process which in the end could all be for nothing if it was rejected in the end. 

She was thinking of going to University to get a student visa and then go the legal work visa route to stay in the UK, but that wouldn’t be possible if she will be refused for an extension on her current status as she needs the time to make all this happen.

She is going to apply for the 1,5-year-extension this summer however she’s worried as she read that many Ukrainians have been refused. a friend of hers from the same region has been accepted for the extension. the friend doesn’t speak english and we are unsure what are the requirements to be accepted for it. 

Has anybody dealt with similar when looking for refuge? how are you guys dealing with this and if there are any Ukrainians in the UK here, what would be her best course of action in this? I really want her to stay in the UK. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1kp2cmp/im_worried_for_my_ukrainian_friend_who_is_scared/,2025-05-17 22:21:53,refugee,35

In today’s fractured geopolitical landscape, the idea of neutrality is facing unprecedented challenges. As the war in Ukraine drags on and tensions escalate in Asia, many smaller or non-aligned countries, including Malaysia, are left to confront an uncomfortable truth: neutrality may no longer be enough.

“To be really neutral is very difficult in the world, which is not stable,” says Denys Mykhailiuk, Ukraine’s acting ambassador to Malaysia.

“Strategic neutrality is typically reserved for strong states that can defend their sovereignty. For many in the Global South, what is described as neutrality is more accurately a form of non-alignment,” he said.

Malaysia, traditionally proud of its non-aligned foreign policy, continues to engage with all parties. Yet experts suggest this approach demands closer scrutiny in an era where global powers are increasingly acting outside international norms.

ukraine,The Netherlands just announced an additional 175 million euro package,"On June 24, 2025, the Dutch government announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth approximately €175 million. The support includes 100 advanced drone detection radars, 20 (partially) unmanned casualty evacuation vehicles (Ermine CASEVAC), and an additional €80 million contribution to the international drone coalition. This package highlights the growing focus on unmanned systems and aerial defense in Ukraine’s war effort.

The 100 drone detection radars are designed to detect hostile drones and relay their location to air defense systems, allowing them to neutralize threats effectively. The delivery of these systems is expected to be completed before the end of 2025. These radars will significantly enhance Ukraine's capacity to protect its airspace against relentless Russian aerial attacks.

The package also includes 20 modular CASEVAC vehicles, which can be used to evacuate wounded soldiers from the battlefield—some of which operate without a crew, improving safety in active conflict zones.

In addition to the €175 million in direct support, the Netherlands recently signed contracts worth €500 million with the Ukrainian defense industry for the production of **600,000 drones**. This massive manufacturing agreement—known as the *Drone Line Initiative*—aims to rapidly boost Ukraine’s frontline capabilities. These drones are seen as critical in preventing Russian forces from gaining ground.

Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans stressed the urgency of bolstering air defense, stating: *“The ruthless daily Russian air attacks show just how vital aerial protection is for Ukraine’s survival.”* He also highlighted the shift towards supporting Ukraine through drone technology and unmanned systems as a key focus of Dutch aid.

This new aid package comes on top of a previously announced €400 million package for maritime security and a prior €20 million Dutch contribution to the drone coalition—raising the total Dutch drone-related support to €100 million.

The Netherlands has consistently played a leading role in supporting Ukraine since the start of the war, now ongoing for more than 3.5 years. Minister Brekelmans emphasized unwavering Dutch solidarity, praising the resilience and courage of the Ukrainian people and calling continued support *“the best way to halt Russia’s brutal expansionism.”*

I am a Ukrainian born composer currently living in the United States. I am working with 3232 Music on a jazz and classical fusion project inspired by Ukrainian folklore.

Our first piece, Chuhayster, has started gaining attention here and it has shown that people outside of Ukraine are deeply moved by Ukrainian stories, especially when they are told with imagination and authenticity.

We are now planning the next piece which may be based on Mavka and I would love to collaborate with a Ukrainian illustrator or animator who is deeply connected to Ukrainian folk imagination. The goal is to make these cultural elements more vivid and emotionally clear, especially for international audiences who may not recognize them on their own.

We are still in the very early stages, just brainstorming and exploring possibilities. Nothing is finalized and no commitments are being made. I am simply hoping to connect with someone who might be interested or who knows someone whose work could be a good fit.

ukraine,Looking forward - would love to hear ppl's thoughts on eventual reconstruction,"Sorry for the vague question, but I only have a vague understanding. Appreciate any input!

I started following Ukraine/Euro news at the start of the war and I'm looking for others' thoughts to deepen my admittedly simplistic view. Would also love accessible resources (podcasts, YT) that go into this regularly. I mostly rely on the Times radio show which is more present/retrospective, not future-oriented.

From everything I've seen it looks like Ukraine is could be poised to become the next Poland, socially/economically once Russia collapses (god willing). Obviously there are big challenges (population decline, corruption, etc.) but I'm saying the potential is there.

My thinking is like this:

Europe knows Ukraine is its best defense against future Russian activity, so it's reasonable to expect extensive aid incoming. The war (in my understanding) has already done a lot to bring Ukraine closer to western Europe in terms of tech, culture, and training. The gov. has been working closely with EU monitors to bring their legal code/corruption standards up to par.

The Ukrainian ppl themselves are unified in a way most countries never experience - they've been actively fighting against Russian influence for more than a decade at this point. I know there's a lot of internal bickering but on the big issues it seems like everyone is on the same page.

Foreign investors would love comparatively cheap, educated labor as long as they felt secure there. And I feel like Ukraine has a strong understanding of western business culture, and the ppl are educated and tech-savvy. The returning refugees also have the potential to bring additional connections, etc. 

**So what might be some serious or interesting challenges? Opportunities?**

For example, I recently learned that a lot of the farm land is in some kind of legal limbo due to soviet-era collective ownership. Sorting that out alone seems like both a huge hurdle and opportunity.

Would really love to hear any thoughts. And if I'm mistaken/dumb, please correct me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1kv8pul/looking_forward_would_love_to_hear_ppls_thoughts/,2025-05-25 19:56:51,internal displacement Ukraine,13
ukraine,"What’s with the silence, West?","We all noticed Trump's clogged pipes after the Ukrainian drone attack on Russian air bases and the destruction of nuclear bombers.

And why is that? Why are we silent? Although he sang so much before, oh so much.

We also do not observe any great joy from the European partners. Well, there are a few responses from those who do not decide anything, such as Boris Johnson, but in general there is a deep strategic silence.

It would seem, why not be happy? You were all so afraid of Russian nuclear weapons - well, we have reduced the number of aircraft that can launch these nuclear weapons by about 41 pieces. Targeting you too btw.

And judging by the unidentified explosions in the port of Severomosk, where Russian nuclear submarines are located, the time is not far when these clay legs of the nuclear Colossus will also buckle thanks to Ukrainian ingenuity.

The question is - why aren't you happy that Ukraine found a way to strike at the Russian nuclear greatness that you were so afraid of?

Today, The New York Times published an article that explains everything.

It turns out that they are all in deep shock, because everything has collapsed. The military was the first to speak.

""Ukraine has taken the war to a new level.""

""Operation ""Web"" showed that it is possible to destroy an aircraft worth over $100 million with the help of a $600 drone.""

And not only an aircraft, we understand. Anything.

""According to a representative of the defense ministry of a European NATO country, Ukraine's strikes will obviously force allies to reconsider the vulnerability of their military facilities.""

Yeah, right.

""The Ukrainians have shown that they can cheaply and effectively create in a matter of months what Western countries have been unable to create for decades for huge money.""

Of course.

“We are gradually beginning to realize the threat that drones pose to American military bases located in many countries and regions of the world.”

WOW, really?

“These bases are unlikely to have protection against short-range weapons, and the lesson of the Ukrainian attack is that a strike on large bases, where many aircraft are located, can be launched at any time.”

You don’t say.

“Moreover, Donald Trump’s $175 billion Golden Dome project, which is supposed to protect the United States from all types of missiles, including with the help of spacecraft, may turn out to be a waste of money,” - General Ben Hodges, former commander of the US Army in Europe.

Well, one hit of an FPV drone on your spacecraft - and that’s it.

And you know what the trick is, guys?
You did all this yourself. 

It was your decision - to first take away all weapons from Ukraine, not just nuclear, but all of them, and leave it naked and barefoot in the face of its asshole neighbor.

From the very beginning of the Russian invasion, it was your decision to give Ukraine as little weapons as possible, while the Russians were pelting us with every possible missile, bomb, and artillery, when the ratio of shells on the battlefield was 1 to 10.

You saw all this, and still came up with some lies, twisted formulations about escalation, and whatever else you wanted - just to not give Ukraine enough weapons - so as not to anger the Russians.

It was your decision - not to give Ukraine long-range missiles. You and the whole world watched as bombed Ukrainian cities bled, almost every day - new tragedies, new collapsed buildings, torn people on the streets, flowers and teddy bears on children's swings.

You looked at all this and helped only with words of ""deep concern"".

Ukrainians asked you, begged you: give us long-range weapons - to destroy their air bases, from where bombers take off.

Ukrainians sent to you a special diplomatic mission: here is a list, here - damn it, look: they brought a map, on the map - these military bases, which we will shoot at with your missiles.

We will not shoot at anything else, fuck the Kremlin, we want Russia to stop killing our people.

No. They did not give it.

They also mocked us. They gave long-range missiles, but they did not give permission to shoot them at Russia.

After the strike on Okhmatdyt, when the Internet was flooded with photos of bloodied sick children, and all social networks exploded with rage with one single message: finally let Ukraine strike back! - no, they did not allow it.

The White House spokesman, then Biden's, came out that day, July 8, and said: ""Nothing has changed in our policy towards Ukraine.""

And now you wonder why Ukraine began to develop drones.

A lot of its own drones. It began to improve them and bring them to a new level. Not only to fight with them on the front lines, but also to get these drones to Russian air bases, from where the fucking bombers take off, killing Ukrainians. And where it could not get them in any other way.

The Ukrainians have the right to destroy these bases and these bombers. And they have no other choice - they are forced to do it in order to survive.

If the Ukrainians had an immeasurable number of YOUR long-range missiles, then it would not have needed to develop Operation ""Spiderweb"", because it would have been slapping those missiles at Russian air bases.

But you didn’t give us missiles, and you can see how it turned out.

“The Russian military will also draw conclusions and try to repeat similar operations in Ukraine or later in NATO countries, and Western militaries should be prepared for this,” military commentators say for The New York Times.

And an Israeli military expert calls June 1, the day the operation was carried out, the beginning of a new era.

Because what Ukraine did is so cheap that almost any terrorist organization could do it – and believe me, they have countless ideas about what objects to attack there, in the West – both in the USA and in Europe.

Any person with an average technical education and a 3D printer can make drones from shit and sticks bought on Amazon and organize such a coordinated attack.

And now, the expert complains, Israel, the United States, Europe - they all need to completely change their strategy for protecting both civilian and military facilities.

All their bulky installations and machinery, which cost millions, turn out to be worthless in front of cheap drones.

Here you go. 
As the NAFO puppers say, the dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubricated.

Ukraine has changed the world again.

IsraelPalestine,The Pro-Palestine movement is slowly proving itself to be a literal terrorist movement filled with hatred,"**Important to note:**

  
**I sympathize with both Israelis and Palestinians** 

**Hamas needs to lay down their weapons, release the living hostages in Gaza and stop abusing Palestinians + I do believe Netanyahu is a bad leader and needs to go as fast as possible, i do agree with him on freeing the Persian people from Khamenei's genocidal regime**

Let's talk about the movement and the **bad** things that happened recently:

\-A few days ago, a Pro-Palestine Left leaning Muslim convert(?) killed 2 **Christian** women in a church while yelling ""Free Palestine"" (Proving that the Intifada is targeted towards **everyone**)

\-A month ago, 6 Jews were nearly **burned** alive by a migrant (Egyptian if i'm not mistaken, **no that doesn't mean i'm Xenophobic towards Egypt**)

\-Despite Keir Starmer's (UK's current PM) concerns about Gaza and Hamas his crew designated the Palestine Action as a **terrorist movement** due to a recent vandalism attack on 2 airplanes which is obviously a crime

\-Back in May, 2 Israeli people were shot by another Left leaning Hasan Piker fan

  
I do care for the people of Israel and Gaza but i'm slowly starting to distance myself from the Pro-Palestine movement, many Pro-Palestine people don't seem to care about Gaza and only want to spew hate and chaos which hurts the cause a lot, I hope they'll learn one day but some prefer to be siding with genocidal terrorist organizations who clearly hate their own supporters which is foolish

IsraelPalestine,Myth: Israel Population Mostly Holocaust Refugees,"I find the following numbers factual and persuasive evidence that helps disprove the antisemitic argument that Israel is a European-white-colonial-project mixed with a Holocaust-Survivor-pity-state. 

Post-1948, Arab countries expelled more Jews (850,000) than Israel took in Holocaust Refugees (350,000). There weren’t many to take in, you know, on account of the N-z- policy of murdering us all. 

Here is a brief overview of the numbers.

Before 1948, 650,000 Jews already lived in the land, many from migrations going back to the 1880s (the Yishuv). https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-population-of-israel-1948-present

You might ask: well, if Israel wasn’t primarily a Holocaust refugee state, how many Jews did it take in and from where and how do you account for the majority of the population?

As mentioned, only 350,000 Holocaust survivors immigrated to Israel after WWII. This is a significant number, but not the majority of Israel’s early Jewish population.
Yad Vashem: https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/remembrance/immigration.asp 

In fact, when looking at sizable Jewish migrant figures, you’ll find the aforementioned fact that 850,000 Jews were expelled from or fled  Arab and Muslim countries (Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Iran) between 1948–1970 due to the formation of Israel. This is more than double the Holocaust refugees Israel took in. 

World Jewish Congress: https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/jews-from-arab-countries-and-iran
JIMENA: https://www.jimena.org/jimena-advocacy/jewish-refugees-from-arab-countries/

Between the pre-existing Israelis and the MENA region refugees, Israel was never simply a “European colonial project.” It was the return of an ancient people (a great number of them from the Middle East) to their ancestral homeland, much of it purchased piece by piece.

What do you think about these numbers? What questions might you have about them?

Edit: this is one of several arguments that disprove the settler colonial framing and by no means the only one. For a brief summary, please see this list I wrote: [Ten Reasons Why Israel is not a Settler Colonial State](https://snailaskwhy.com/2024/11/21/10-reasons-why-israel-is-not-a-settler-colonial-state/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lep7fd/myth_israel_population_mostly_holocaust_refugees/,2025-06-18 20:49:56,migrant,69
IsraelPalestine,If the IDF touches Greta thunberg it’s over….,"Ya know the other day I was looking into this story about why the chicago police and fbi raided the Chicago neighborhood parkway gardens which we call “o block” that neighborhood has been suffering through crime for years, but wanna know why out of no where decide to raid it? Because there was shooting up in the safer part of Chicago where the rich white folks live, so they was like nuh uh we not having that time to raid this shit.

Or how about this through out the world there is conflict and war going all the time especially in Africa and the Middle East, not many people cared but then in 2022 something interesting happened….. Russia invades Ukraine AND WE ALL GO CRAZY, you guys think Palestine stuff on TikTok is out of hand? Let me tell you the Ukraine war was much more on my TikTok then Palestine stuff, I still have apolitical friends who knew about Ukraine but don’t  know about Palestine 

Anyways when Russia invaded Ukraine it was OMG THIS IS THE FIRST WAR IN EUROPE SINCE WW2! HELP WE ALL GONNA DIE RUSSIA GONNA KILL US. You didn’t the same type of reaction with Syria, Congo , or Sudan 

So let me tell you, if the IDF lay a hand on Greta thumberg, a western white woman, it’s over, it’s done no more money, war over, the west will not stand for it, it will be news everywhere, yes this one thing will get way more attention than the 100s of thousands of Gazans who died.

IsraelPalestine,Is it just me or is Qatar basically everything people accuse Israel of being?,"At this point Qatar feels less like a country and more like a Bond villain. Like, imagine a tiny, oil-soaked state run by a royal family that controls everything from the media to the military to foreign policy - all behind closed doors - while throwing money around the world to buy silence and influence. That’s literally Qatar.

They’re running what basically amounts to a shadow government. 85% of the people living there are migrant workers treated like disposable parts. Somehow they get a free pass because they are literally buying everything. Qatar is literally run like a royal mafia and no one bats an eye.

Qatar has basically bought its way into the West. They’re buying it. Think tanks, universities, media outlets, politicians. There was an actual EU scandal where MEPs were caught with bags of cash from Qatar, and the world just kind of moved on. They also literally bought people in NETANYAHU's office. In the U.S., they’ve greased both parties, and you’ll find Qatari-funded “research” in all the prestigious places that shape foreign policy. They openly tried to bribe Trump now, and their propaganda and manipulations are much more deadly and aggressive than the little Israel does. They are openly bribing everyone and seduces politicians with luxury trips and hotels.

It’s not just politics either,Qatar literally bought the World Cup,psg Neymar, Mbappé, Messi - all pawns in a PR campaign to rebrand a country where being gay is illegal, women need permission to live their lives, and dissent is crushed. FIFA tried to push rainbow armbands, Qatar said no, and FIFA backed down in two seconds. That’s how much power they wield.

Qatar plays this creepy double game on the global stage. They host the biggest U.S. military base in the region and fund Hamas and worldwide jihad and Islamists in universities. They act like “mediators” in every conflict, but they’re the ones cutting checks to extremists and giving airtime to radicals. Pressuring the West with one hand and hugging terrorists with the other. Its some Chancellor Palpatine level shit.

They reportedly tried to fly Edan Alexander-an Israeli-American hostage held by Hamas-to Qatar to parade him around basically like a trophy in the day he was released. He was literally kidnapped by a group Qatar funds, and they wanted to use him like a trophy. This is a new level of cynicism, evil, and audacity.. Imagine burning down someone’s house and then showing up with a TV crew to donate them a new couch.

So yeah, Israel’s not above criticism. But Qatar is literally doing all the shady stuff people project onto Israel, just with better lighting and a lot more money. The fact that they keep getting away with it tells you everything you need to know about how performative global outrage really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1kpdn08/is_it_just_me_or_is_qatar_basically_everything/,2025-05-18 08:38:31,migrant,162

Second edit: the user noticed and messaged me. They promised a response around June, so they did see this.

***Knock, knock***

Let's go point by point. I could do an essay, but apparently loads of other people have already beaten me to the punch, so I'll just provide cliffnotes and sources.

1. ""*Hamas using human shield*.""

First point out of the gate, you got one that's semi functional. There is a lot of circumstantial evidence on whether Hamas uses people as meat shields. By all accounts, no, they do not use them literally as meat shields, in the sense of holding them up to take gunfire instead.

However, they did use residential areas to store and launch weapons. In fact, Hezbollah, Hamas's older brother, has been frequently cited to use civilian areas to house and use weapons of war. During the Lebanon war in 2006, Hezbollah was accused of using residential areas and human shields.

Again, most of this claim is circumstantial. But I'm hard pressed to ask why they are storing missiles where hospitals, schools, and homes should be. There's a reason why we have military bases, and civilian areas.

2. *Israel was willing to share the land*

You actually brought sources this time, so good job there! Let me disassemble them.

>Palestine must be built up without violating the legitimate interests of the Arabs – not a hair of their heads shall be touched

– Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel, addressing the Fourteenth Zionist Congress in Vienna, 1925

I can use cherry picked quotes lmao. But let's be serious here.

From the late 1800s to 1907, the Zionist movement took root. Massive waves of Jews moved into the Levant, including Syria and what would be called Jordan. And then the clownery began with a lil piece of paper;

# 1908

* First edition of [*Al-Karmil*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Karmil_(newspaper)), an anti-Zionist newspaper, published in [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa)

# 1913

* [Moshe Barsky falls victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Moshe_Barsky) to Arab [Bedouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin) raiders.

Around this time, Hussein Bey al-Husayni, major of Jerusalem, emphasized how Zionism wasn't bad for Palestine, and he also begged for understanding during this rising tide of tension. Pity his relative Amin al-Husseini didn't take the hint and instead became an honorary Aryan instead, but I digress. Point is, Hussein told people to stop selling land to settlers, but hey, money is nice.

Now you might say, ""Hey, but what about Zionism being called a colonialist movement!"" Well, you're half right. The European Jews during the late 1800s into the early 1900s certainly thought that. Everyone was colonizing everyone else during this point. Manifest destiny and all that, empires expanding. Ya know, very common thought process. In fact, the Ottoman Empire was one such colonizing power, too. But I'll be fair. Zionists did take Palestinian land... by buying it from wealthy Arab families. In fact, the Young Turks even sold land to Jews in Syria. Funny how things play out.

Basically I want to make this point to show two things. A) Jewish people are fallible and can do bad things. B) The 1800s into early 1900s were pretty imperialist. Everyone and their mother thought that. Honestly, America was considered an odd duck during World War 1 by being anti-imperialist, compared to the very imperial Europe. So, no surprise there.

Now, while all this is going on, Arab nationalists are clamoring for a ""Greater Syria,"" which includes Jordan, Lebanon, Israel/Palestine, Syria, and Turkey...

Once we're into 1920, things basically implode. Riots, demonstrations, the Franco-Syrian war, all before you know what. It's all down hill for Jews experiencing any level of peace.

*3. Arab citizens have the same right as an Israeli in Israel*

Okay, this point is where you absolutely lose me. This is blatantly false, and even in the article you provided states they have the SAME RIGHTS. They don't even need to serve, which all Israeli and even Druze have to do. Arabs live in poor neighborhoods, oh no, so that magically makes black Americans second class citizens? Bother reading your sources before posting it without actually knowing what you're posting.

*4. The Israeli has an ancestral claim on Palestine*

Now this point is so badly made that I need to refrain from dropping link after link. What you are arguing is, basically, because the Native Americans are no longer in a majority of the US, they no longer have any ancestral connection to this land! See how braindead that sounds?

Look at this chart on Wikipedia over the Ottoman demographics in the Levant. Jews never left. Most were scattered, but some still remained, and most of the modern day so-called Palestinians were migrants moving around the Ottoman Empire.

Read and weep.

6. *Hamas dismembered babies*

You get this one point. They did dance over toddlers' coffins though, so, not much of a point.

7. *There is no ethnic cleansing since the Gaza population grew*

There is, in fact, no ethnic cleansing. Violence, yes. Bombardment, absolutely. But that's war, honey. Was America during WW2 ""ethnically cleansing"" the Japanese during the fire bombing in Tokyo? No. We also had camps for Japanese Americans, but none really died, so still no ethnic cleansing there, either.

You know what is ethnic cleansing though? From water to water, Palestine will be Arab"" or ""من المية للمية فلسطين عربية""

8. *Israel left Gaza in 2005* 

This is literally a non-argument. Especially since this was during the time where the oh-so-wonderful show for children, ""Pioneers of Tomorrow,"" was made. Gazans couldn't help feeling Israeli presence cuz Hamas kept reminding them!

9. *Hamas build tunnel* 

I'll refer back to the human shields argument on why this is braindead. Why are you building tunnels and storing weapons IN CIVILIAN DISTRICTS?

10. *Hamas broke the ceasefire* 

Well, Hamas DID start all this by, well, randomly attacking a music concert and kidnapping a bunch of civilians. And don't give me this ""oh but the Hannibal directive!"" bs. Hamas started this. Why did they do this? Riddle me that. During a time of quiet, they planned this whole moronic stunt, and for what? Possibly because Israel and Saudi Arabia were in talks over peace and trades. That seems like the BIGGEST violation to a ceasefire, invading a country to stop it from making peace deals with another country unrelated to your own.

11. *Hamas is the one responsible for the deaths of Gazan civilians* argument

They... are? They are killing their own. They're a tyrannical death cult, is it really that striking? Literally one of their leaders was called The Butcher of Khan Younis, and he even killed a prominent Hamas member cuz the guy was GAY! Howidy Hamza documents this, as well as criticism towards the IDF, which I'm sure you'll love.

12. *Criticizing Israel is antisemitic* 

No, criticizing Israel itself isn't anti semitic. Holding Israel to some kind of higher standard than the rest of the world IS, however. Dismissing years and centuries of pogroms, disaposa, and the H0locaust's influence is antisemtic. Dismissing Israel as the only state that should be removed, ignoring how Saudi Arabia and Jordan are both colonial countries made around the same time, as well as ignoring how much of the Arabic world treats the Palestinians, yes, you are anti semitic if you don't pass the same pressure and criticism on everyone else doing the same thing!

IsraelPalestine,Getting Tired of the Same Old Excuses for What’s Happening in Palestine,"Has anyone noticed that it's always the same recycled arguments being pushed to justify what is happening? Examples:

* If you’re pro-Palestine, you should move there and “help”- because apparently empathy is only valid if you’re on the ground. (funny thing is, even if you want to go help, Israel would not let you in with anything that could actually help)
* If you’re Jewish and criticize what’s happening, you must be a self-hating Jew brainwashed by propaganda - because being Jewish is now conflated with agreeing unconditionally with the Israeli government. 
* If every major humanitarian organization reports that people in Gaza are starving, they’re suddenly all anti-Semitic, uncredible and exaggerating (including Doctors Without Borders, WHO, UNICEF, and Human Rights Watch)
* If the International Court of Justice finds evidence of war crimes, then suddenly these respected institutions are biased, corrupt, or anti-Semitic too.
* If there’s a discussion about civilians being targeted, it’s brushed off with *“That’s just how war works.”*
* If the head of the Israeli state openly says the goal is to cleanse Gaza of all Gazans, the response is either *“It’s not gen\*\*\*, it's self-defence as Palestinians were raised to want to kill us,”* or *“That’s just one person, it’s being taken out of context, he doesn’t speak for the whole government.”*
* If there's outrage about the death toll, it’s deflected with: *“It’s not us-it’s Hamas using them as human shields.”*
* If hospitals, ambulances, or refugee camps are bombed, it’s: *“Hamas was hiding there,”* even when no evidence is provided.
* If the death toll includes thousands of children, the response is: *“Blame Hamas. We warned them to evacuate,”* conveniently ignoring that there’s nowhere safe to go.
* If videos emerge of soldiers celebrating bombings or humiliating civilians, it’s *“those are fringe cases”* .. despite the lack of accountability.
* If aid is blocked or limited, it’s *“We can’t guarantee it won’t reach Hamas,”* while people die of dehydration, infection, and hunger.
* If journalists are killed, it’s *“Collateral damage”* \-  even when they’re clearly marked press.
* If critics point to mass displacement, they're told: *“It’s not ethnic cleansing. It’s necessary for our security.”*

* If anyone questions the Israeli narrative, they’re accused of being biased, naive, or supporting terrorism, even if they’re legal scholars, doctors, journalists, or former Israeli officials.
* If someone cites Palestinian suffering, the response is often: *“But what about October 7th?”* as if one atrocity permanently justifies unlimited violence in return.
* If independent studies (like from The Lancet) show higher death tolls than official figures, they’re dismissed as “based on Hamas sources,” even when the methodology is transparent and peer-reviewed.
* If someone calls for a ceasefire, they’re accused of supporting Hamas, as if calling for civilian life to be spared is inherently extremist.

The logic is always the same: Israel is never at fault. Everyone else - the media, the courts, the human rights groups, even civilians - is either lying, naive, or complicit with terrorists.

This isn’t a defense. It’s a refusal to acknowledge the consequences of unchecked military power and dehumanization.

IsraelPalestine,There are two kinds of resistance. Choosing the wrong one kind makes victory impossible.,"Let's completely ignore Israeli and Jewish history and go with the Pro-Palestinian perspective on who Israelis are. Let's say Israelis are colonizers whose ancestors never set foot in Israel, but are simply Europeans collectively hallucinating about their background. Let's assume Jews collectively hallucinated that they were refugees for some reason and showed up in Palestine. And then even though Palestinians were super nice to them and never massacred them or anything, the Jews suddenly displaced Palestinians because those Jews were evil. And then Jews stole their land, and then forced Palestinians to live under apartheid not because Palestinians were stabbing them or anything, but because Israelis are racists. And so what Palestinians have done for the last 70 years and continue to do is simply justified resistance.

If you, as a resisting group, wants equal rights and citizenship — like black people in South Africa under apartheid, or black people in the U.S. during the Civil Rights movements — what you have to do is convince the majority population that they can live peacefully as your neighbors. That means your resistance has to be primarily nonviolent and full of peaceful messages, because no one wants to live next to the person who murdered their child. That's why Civil Rights leaders were not going on rape and murder sprees, however ""justified."" That's why black people during apartheid were not marching house to house, murdering white children.

The only time violent resistance makes sense is if you don't want to live next to your neighbors, but you want your neighbors to leave and go back to where they came from. That's why Algerians could be successful in their resistance — they were trying to get the French to go back to France, not trying to live as equal citizens next to the French. The Vietnamese were not trying to live next to Americans, they were trying to get the Americans to leave. Many Palestinians think they can use the same tactics to get Jews to leave.

Here's the problem with that: The French knew they were colonizers from France. The U.S. knew they were troops from the U.S. Both groups knew they always go back to their true original home, the place of their culture, the place where everyone spoke their language. But Israelis — say, due to collective hallucination — mistakenly believe they are indigenous people of Israel, and that they have no other home. They believe that they were violently displaced from other places, and they can't go back to those places, and will never be safe living under some other culture's rule thanks to 2000 years of persecution every time they tried. So this model of Jews simply going back to their ""real"" homes isn't going to work either.

If you try violent resistance and fail, the group of people you attacked is not going to give you citizenship as some sort of consolation prize. They are going to fear you and not want to live with you. They will not trust you. They will not want you around. By choosing violent resistance, Palestinians are doing the opposite of convincing Israelis that Israelis will live good lives with Palestinians as their neighbors. By choosing violent resistance, Palestinians are banking fully on the idea that Jews will go back to where they came from. (And no, combining nonviolent and violent resistance is not going to convince the majority population that you are safe either.)

This applies to the kinds of things people say at protests and on social media too. If Israelis think that ""from the river to the sea"" or ""by any means necessary"" and calling them ""colonizers"" refers to ethically cleansing them, it doesn't matter if you just thought the slogans were catchy, or that you meant them differently, or that not every protester thinks that way. The impression Israelis — those silly hallucinators — are getting is that you want to kill or displace them all. If you want Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side, you would be waving Israeli and Palestinian flags together, and kicking out anyone at your protests talking about intifada.

By choosing violent resistance against a group that considers itself the natives, you ensure that they will fight and kill as many of you as they need to in order to protect themselves from you — since, like it or not, they consider *you* the invader in their house.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1m6qhf6/there_are_two_kinds_of_resistance_choosing_the/,2025-07-22 23:18:26,refugee,65
IsraelPalestine,Israel and Palestine: Victims of a Wider Conflict,"  
**Preface**  
  
*I’ve talked about this conflict before, but recently it’s been getting to me in a different way. Not just because of what’s happening, which is horrific, but because of how people talk about it. Almost every conversation I’ve had ends up in the same place: people shutting down the moment you bring up history, calling any context “propaganda,” and refusing to even listen if it doesn’t match their narrative.*

*I want to be clear: I oppose both Netanyahu and Hamas I think they are two sides of a brutal, self-serving machine.They’re both contributing to the horror we're seeing and making peace even harder to reach. Neither of them represents justice or safety they’re both clinging to power through fear and violence.*

*But what I’m trying to do here is talk about the broader context. This conflict didn’t start with airstrikes, or a blockade, or even October 7. It goes way back. And the more you look into the history, the harder it is to sit through the current narrative without feeling like half the story is being left out. Especially when some of the same countries that helped fuel the conflict in the first place are now acting like they’ve always been on the sidelines.*

*This is my attempt to put that into words :*

This is what I’ve always said, and what I stand by:  
**Israel, and especially Palestinians, are victims of a much wider conflict.**

And the ones who created that conflict? The surrounding Arab states, who have spent nearly a century using the Palestinian people as scapegoats, pawns, and PR tools while doing virtually nothing meaningful to help them.

# The Arab States Never Cared About Palestinian Independence

Arab regimes, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Iraq have historically treated Palestinians as second-class people.

They blocked Palestinian independence repeatedly, both before and after 1948:

* During the British Mandate, they sabotaged internal Palestinian leadership in favour of placing their own puppets in charge.
* After 1948, when Jordan annexed the West Bank and Egypt took control of Gaza, neither declared a Palestinian state. Not in 1948. Not in 1967. Not ever.
* To this day, countries like Lebanon and Syria have denied Palestinians basic rights, citizenship, employment, and property ownership.

They have done everything in their power to keep Palestinians stateless and dependent, and then cry crocodile tears when it suits their anti-Israel narrative.

# They Waged a Genocidal War and lost. Let’s not sugarcoat it.

In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition: a Jewish state and an Arab state.

The Jews accepted it, despite the fact that the proposed Jewish territory was mostly desert and Jerusalem was to be internationalised. The Arab states rejected it, not because of borders, but because they refused to tolerate any Jewish sovereignty in the region.

The very next day after Israel declared independence in May 1948, five Arab armies invaded. Their leaders, including Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha, explicitly described it as a “war of extermination.” A genocide. Just three years after the Holocaust.

They lost. And then they cried foul.

This was not a peaceful people brutally displaced. This was a coordinated attempt to eliminate a new, sovereign state. It failed. And they have been rewriting the story ever since.

# And the Palestinians? Caught in the Middle, Then Abandoned

No one denies that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced in 1948. But here’s what rarely gets mentioned:

* Many fled because Arab leaders told them to, promising a quick return after they destroyed the Jews.
* Others fled due to legitimate fear, war, or in some cases forced expulsion. But this happened in the context of a war those same leaders started.
* When the war ended and Arab states had Palestinian land, did they build Palestine? No. They took it. They governed it. They denied independence again.

These regimes turned a tragedy they created into a permanent grievance. A tool to bash Israel, deflect from their own corruption, and score PR points with the West.

And that’s where we are now. Arab states have done the absolute minimum for Palestinian people while pretending to be their champions. Meanwhile, every failure of their own becomes “proof” that the Jews are evil.

# Today’s discourse ignores all of this

Most of what we see online today is just selective outrage. People who:

* Only start paying attention at the moment bombs fall,
* Completely ignore who started each war,
* Parrot terms like “genocide” or “stolen land” without ever engaging with the 1947–49 timeline
* Dismiss any attempt to provide context as “Zionist propaganda.”

I’ve had it. Because Palestinian suffering is real, but it has been exploited and perpetuated for decades by their own so-called allies.

If you want to actually advocate for Palestinians, then hold the regimes who created this disaster accountable.

If you're only blaming Israel while whitewashing the Arab invasions, denying the Grand Mufti's Nazi collaboration, and ignoring seventy-plus years of political manipulation by Arab governments, then you're not pro-Palestinian. You're just anti-Israel.

And the usual response to this statement is ""but they stole their land"" 

The UN Partition Plan proposed dividing Mandatory Palestine into two states : one Jewish, one Arab. The proposed Jewish state made up about 55 percent of the territory, even though Jews only legally owned around 7 percent of the land at the time.

That sounds unfair, until you actually understand the context.

Jews are not foreigners to the land. They are indigenous to it, just as much as the Arab population. Jewish presence in the region predates Islam, predates the Arab conquest, and has never been fully broken, even after thousands of years of exile, persecution, massacres, and forced conversions across Europe and the Middle East.

The reason there were fewer Jews in the land by the modern era wasn’t because they were outsiders, but because they had been systematically driven out, enslaved, taxed into poverty, and repeatedly targeted by violent pogroms, both in Europe and under various Islamic regimes. Still, there were always Jewish communities in Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias, and Safed, long before Zionism even existed.

By the 20th century, the Jewish population was growing rapidly through legal immigration and land purchase, and had already built functional institutions, agriculture, infrastructure, education systems, and a defence force. They were absorbing waves of Jewish refugees, including Holocaust survivors and were prepared to govern themselves.

In contrast, the Arab leadership rejected any form of compromise or shared governance. And in 1947, they rejected the partition plan not because of unfair borders, but because they refused the idea of a Jewish state in any form.

>  
“This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades.” Azzam Pasha (Secretary‑General of the Arab League)

And this wasn’t just rhetorical posturing. The most prominent Palestinian Arab figure at the time, Haj Amin al-Husseini, didn’t rise to power organically. He was appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem by the British with heavy pressure from Egypt, which saw him as a useful political ally and proxy in the region. He wasn’t chosen by the Palestinian people, but was elevated by outside forces with their own agendas. Once in power, he pushed a hardline, antisemitic agenda, and during World War II, he fled to Nazi Germany, where he met personally with Hitler in 1941. He offered to rally Muslims in support of the Nazi cause and actively opposed any Jewish refugees from Europe being allowed into Palestine. He later helped organise the 13th Waffen SS Handžar Division, a Muslim Nazi unit responsible for atrocities in the Balkans, and made Arabic-language radio broadcasts calling for the extermination of Jews. This wasn’t a fringe character, this was the face of Palestinian political leadership at the time, backed by regional powers and aligned with Nazi Germany during the Holocaust, openly advocating for the genocide to continue in the Middle East.

So when people say “but Israel was created because of the Holocaust,” it’s worth remembering that Arab leaders at the time weren’t innocent bystanders, they were actively collaborating with the perpetrators and preparing to carry out similar policies in Palestine if given the chance.

The Jews accepted a compromise, even though much of the land they were offered was arid or disconnected. The Arabs chose war instead.

And as soon as they had the chance, the Arab League attempted another genocide, openly declaring their intent to destroy the Jewish state at birth. This was not a war for Palestinian liberation. It was a war of annihilation, launched by regimes whose hatred of Jewish sovereignty ran far deeper than any concern for Palestinian self-determination.

I am genuinely baffled at how rarely this is acknowledged. This was never just a conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It has always been a broader campaign driven by surrounding Arab states and their leadership, many of whom were steeped in antisemitic ideology, opposed any Jewish presence in the region, and weaponised the Palestinian cause to cover for their own aggression, failures, and internal repression.   
You don’t get to reject a peaceful two-state solution, initiate a war to wipe the other side out, and then turn around and say your land was stolen. That isn’t justice. That’s the result of choices made and wars lost.

What makes me angriest, more than anything, is how this has been turned into a dichotomous conflict, a black-and-white story, good versus evil, occupier versus victim, oppressor versus resistance, when the truth is so much messier and so much more tragic. Both peoples, Israelis and Palestinians, started out asking for the same thing: a place to live, a state of their own, safety after centuries of being ruled by others. They could have had that. But instead, they were turned against each other poisoned by the ambitions, hatreds, and power plays of the regimes around them.

The surrounding Arab states injected this conflict with absolutism and vengeance. They made it about erasing the other side, not living alongside it. They filled the region with promises of victory and revenge, and when it all fell apart, they blamed everyone else. Their hate didn’t just kill hope, it perverted the hearts of people, seeped into both societies, and made peace feel impossible.

And now, somehow, **they’re walking away clean**. After decades of rejection, incitement, manipulation, and betrayal, they get to rebrand themselves as neutral observers or moral authorities, while the two peoples they helped destroy are still paying the price. That’s what I can’t get over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1m6f7ls/israel_and_palestine_victims_of_a_wider_conflict/,2025-07-22 16:13:59,refugee,7
IsraelPalestine,The Demonisation of Zionism and Israel,"In the 21st century, few political movements have been as distorted and misrepresented as zionism. what began as a liberation movement for a persecuted people has been weaponised as a term of slander, often equated with racism or colonialism. this demonisation is not only historically inaccurate but deeply entangled with modern anti-semitism. to understand the necessity of a jewish state and the authentic meaning of zionism you must separate the fact from propaganda and resviit the historical context that gave birth to both Israel and the movement that preceded it.

**Zionism is the belief in the Jewish people's right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland.**

 it is neither inherently expansionist nor exclusive; it arose as a direct response to centuries of statelessness, persecution, and expulsion. the jewish connection to the land of Isreal is over 3,000 years old, predating the Roman exile of 70 CE. throughout centuries of diaspora, Jews maintained both a spiritual and cultural attachment to this land, as evidenced in prayers, traditions, and repeated waves of migration. theodor herzl’s formalisation of zionism in the late 19th century was not born out of imperial ambition but as a direct reaction to european anti-semitism, most famously exemplified by the dreyfus affair in france. Herzl recognised that assimilation, even in the most progressive societies, would not protect Jews from systemic hatred.

this hatred reached its peak during the holocaust, where some of my relatives perished, and where the absence of a jewish homeland allowed the systematic extermination of six million jews. The foundation of israel in 1948 was therefore not merely a political event but an existential necessity. as british diplomat Sir Martin Gilbert wrote, “israel was not created in compensation for the Holocaust, but the Holocaust demonstrated beyond all doubt the need for a Jewish state.” even after 1948, jews in arab lands were subjected to violent pogroms and expulsions, resulting in the forced displacement of over 850,000 Jews from Arab countries between 1948 and the early 1970s—a historical fact often ignored when discussing Middle Eastern refugee crises. israel have refuge to these jews, alongside Holocaust survivors, transforming a persecuted diaspora into a nation with sovereignty and security.

the demonisation of zionism today often rests on deliberate mischaracterisations. critics who brand zionism as “colonialism” ignore the fact that jews are indigenous to the land, unlike european colonial powers that invaded foreign territories for economic gain. israel’s re-establishment was not a colonial project imposed by the West but the revival of a nation-state that had existed long before the modern Arab states were formed. zionism was and remains a liberation movement, one that sought to end Jewish subjugation. To equate it with racism is a modern form of anti-Semitism, as recognised by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which includes the delegitimisation of israel as an expression of anti-Semitism.

The link between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism is evident in the rhetoric that uniquely targets Israel among all nations. for example, while over 20 arab states openly define themselves as arab nations, and 50 countries worldwide define themselves along ethnic or religious lines (such as the Islamic Republic of Iran or the Hellenic Republic of Greece), the notion of a jewish state is singled out as illegitimate. this double standard is not rooted in political critique but in the centuries-old view of Jews as perpetual outsiders, unworthy of sovereignty. United Nations statistics highlight this bias: between 2015 and 2022, over 70% of country-specific resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly targeted Israel, while egregious human rights abusers such as north korea, china, and iran faced only a fraction of the scrutiny.

the necessity of a jewish state is underscored by the persistence of anti-Semitism even after the Holocaust. In 2023, the anti-defamation league (ADL) recorded a 337% increase in anti-Semitic incidents globally compared to 2022, with over 9,000 reported cases in the United States alone—the highest number since record-keeping began. In france, home to europe’s largest Jewish population, jewish schools and synagogues require armed military guards. without israel, jews would once again be at the mercy of foreign governments to protect their basic rights. the state of Israel, while imperfect like any other, remains the only guarantee that the Jewish people will never again face extermination without refuge or defense.

the real and accurate meaning of zionism must therefore be reclaimed. It is not a movement of hatred or supremacy, but of survival, renewal, and self-determination. It does not negate palestinian identity or aspirations, despite attempts to frame the conflict as a zero-sum struggle. Indeed, multiple israeli governments have supported a two-state solution, while terrorist groups like hamas openly declare their goal as the annhilation of israel and jews worldwide, as stated explicitly in their 1988 charter. To attack zionism is to attack the jewish people’s right to exist in safety and dignity, a right that is non-negotiable.

the demonisation of zionism is not just a political issue but a moral one. when zionist becomes a slur, it presents the anti-Semitic caricatures of past centuries, only hidden in the language of modern activism. it is crucial to distinguish between legitimate criticism of Israel’s policies, of which Israelis themselves are often the fiercest critics, nd the delegitimisation of Israel’s existence. the latter is not progressivism but a continuation of one of humanity’s oldest hatreds. to defend zionism is not merely to defend Israel; it is to defend the principle that no people should be denied the right to self-determination because of their ethnicity or faith.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1m4ix6o/the_demonisation_of_zionism_and_israel/,2025-07-20 09:28:48,refugee,12
IsraelPalestine,the mass displacement,"let's start with the usual reminder, this conflict isn't about ""settlements"" or ""apartheid"", this conflict isn't even about gaza and the west bank.

in 1947 there was the UN partition plan which the jews agreed to, the partition plan would have made it possible for 2 states to co-exist without any need for displacements, a Jewish majority country and another arab muslim country (if they didn't have enough) in the territory of the former British mandate of Palestine.

the arabs rejected, started a war and as a result of that war and the territorial changes, displacements of Palestinians and also jews occurred.

but of course it didn't end there, the UN founded UNRWA which made it their purpose to prolong the conflict until it's resolved on their terms(no Jewish state) by pumping up refugees(refugee status can't end until they are back in ""their"" lands and the status is passed down to children) instead of solving refugee issues and co-operating with terrorists entities to destroy israel.

throughout 1948-1967 (when the west bank was under jordan control and gaza was under Egypt control) arab countries and ""Palestinians"" attacked israel relentlessly, which means the west bank and gaza definitely aren't the issue in this conflict.

pro ""Palestinians"" justify these actions with their altered term ""nakba"" from the propaganda script.

regardless, does it really justify these actions? there are tons of wars where people were diplaced to never return but they don't put suicide vests on themselves because of that.

Between 850,000 and 1,000,000 Jews were expelled from Middle East/North Africa (MENA) countries after 1948 with little more than the clothes on their backs. The amount of assets stolen from them is estimated at up to $250Billion, including land more than 5 times the size of Israel.

(we didn't get a shekel of course and no acknowledgment of responsibility)

so if the expulsion of around 700k ""Palestinians"" in 1948, (where many have returned) justifies all they did, then what does the obviously worse expulsion of jews from the middle eastern countries justify?

i know I'm gonna see some conspiracy theories about how almost a million ""greedy jews"" suddenly decided to give all their assets and homes for their ""jewish tricks"", or how some alleged Baghdad bombings caused almost 1 million jews to migrate from different countries in Asia and Africa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1m3f6hg/the_mass_displacement/,2025-07-18 23:55:39,refugee,8

# Is There a Palestinian Equivalency? Examining the Record of Muslim Displacement by Jews

**A central question in any honest reckoning of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is whether both sides have engaged in comparable patterns of ethnic cleansing.** Many activists frame the issue as a tit-for-tat cycle of dispossession. Yet the historical record does not support a claim of equivalency when it comes to Muslims being expelled en masse from Jewish-majority lands. The displacement of Palestinians is real, tragic, and well documented. But the idea that Jews have driven Muslims out of a broader Middle Eastern homeland, in the way Jews were expelled from Muslim lands, simply does not hold up to scrutiny.

First, it must be stated clearly: **there were no significant Jewish-majority states in the Middle East** until the founding of Israel in 1948. For centuries, Jews were a small minority under Muslim rule. They had neither the political power nor the military means to expel anyone. The idea of Jews as colonizers of the Muslim world is an inversion of the actual history, in which Jewish communities often lived under restrictive, second-class status (dhimmi) in Muslim-majority societies.

In the case of Israel itself, **the 1948 war and subsequent Palestinian refugee crisis are undeniable facts.** An estimated **700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled** during the fighting that accompanied the creation of the Israeli state. Some left out of fear, some were pushed out by Israeli forces, and others were urged to evacuate by Arab leaders promising a swift military victory. The historical debate over exactly how much of this displacement was planned versus incidental continues to this day.

However, this event, tragic as it was, is geographically narrow. **It pertains to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea**, not to some broader campaign of Jewish-led Muslim expulsions across the Arab world. By contrast, the Jewish exodus from Arab lands spanned **dozens of countries** and was driven by state-level policies of persecution, confiscation, and forced expulsion.

Furthermore, **Muslims remain a growing and vibrant population within Israel today.** Roughly **two million Arab citizens of Israel** (nearly 20 percent of the population) live within the state, with citizenship rights, representation in the Knesset, and full religious freedoms. While discrimination and inequality exist — as in many societies — there has been no Israeli policy of driving Muslims out of Israel. In fact, the Muslim population of Israel has grown consistently since 1948.

In short, **there is no moral equivalency between the forced expulsion of Jews from the Muslim world** — which reduced ancient Jewish communities to near zero — and the Palestinian refugee tragedy, which, while real, has not been mirrored by a broader campaign of Jewish-led Muslim displacement across the region. Nor is there an effort today to push Israel’s Muslim citizens into exile.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1m3c3lq/free_palestine_from_hamas/,2025-07-18 21:49:08,refugee,24
IsraelPalestine,UNwatch,"an invitation for you to watch the UN instead of watching their hands point towards jews, once you pay attention then the magic show isn't as captivating

actually there is a organization called UNwatch, here are some wonderful examples of their articles:

https://unwatch.org/issue-647-u-n-elects-qatar-congo-pakistan-top-rights-body-u-s-pulls-unesco/

https://unwatch.org/issue-637-u-n-report-israel-blame-palestinian-men-beating-wives/

there is a lot more where it's coming from so don't worry.

but regarding the israeli palestine issue and why the UN as a body is worthless, besides being worthless they have also picked a side so they can't be used as a non biased source, here are some key facts for those who still pretend the UN is some kind of ""peace keeping"" body

UNRWA was founded in 1949, long before the so called ""israeli occupation""(1967) that the moderate pro ""Palestinians"" claim is the sole reason for the conflict:

UNRWA is an organization whose purpose is to prolong the Palestine conflict until it's resolved in the desired way(israel is destroyed)

I'm not talking about recent stuff regarding co-operation with hamas 

https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-condemns-placement-rockets-second-time-one-its-schools

I'm talking about it's inherent purpose for existing, the UN has 2 agencies for refugees, one for the Palestinians(UNRWA) and one for the rest of the world(UNHCR)

UNHCR:

The primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees globally. 
UNHCR works with refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced people, regardless of their origin, aiming to ensure they can exercise their right to seek asylum and find safe refuge. 

UNHCR determines that a person is no longer a refugee through a process called cessation of refugee status, based on Article 1C of the 1951 Refugee Convention. This happens when international protection is no longer necessary or justified due to changes in the refugee’s circumstances or in their country of origin

UNRWA: 

Operates within the specified geographic areas, providing direct services to Palestinian refugees. 
Areas of Operation:
Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), and the Gaza Strip. 

Defines and registers Palestine refugees based on a unique mandate:

Those who lived in Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948 and lost homes/livelihood due to the 1948 conflict.

- Hereditary refugee status: Descendants of male Palestine refugees can inherit refugee status, even generations later, which prolongs the conflict for eternity and increase the number of refugees regardless of their conditions(yes, even Palestinian billionaires are refugees) until they can return to ""their"" lands of before the 1967 borders, which means displacing Israelis 

so we can clearly see the UN goal of creating UNRWA.

there is another key factor which blatantly shows the UN hateful agenda against israel- their support for the PLO.

the PLO was founded in 1964, also before the so called ""occupation"", and obviously they started attacking israel instead of trying to gain independence under the rule of egypt and jordan(and it's not like ""Palestinians"" haven't attacked israel before 1964)

the PLO goals are the destruction of Israel:

The original PLO Charter (Palestinian National Covenant), particularly the 1968 version, called for the destruction of Israel and rejected its legitimacy.

What the Charter Said:
- Article 9: Declared that armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine, making it the overall strategy.
- Article 15: Called for the elimination of Zionism in Palestine, which many interpret as a euphemism for dismantling the State of Israel.
- Article 19: Stated that the establishment of Israel is entirely illegal, regardless of time passed.
- Article 22: Described Zionism as a racist, imperialist, fascist movement and Israel as its instrument.

Attempts to Amend the Charter:
- In 1996, the Palestinian National Council voted to amend the Charter to remove clauses inconsistent with the Oslo Accords, which included recognizing Israel.
- However, the vote did not meet the required two-thirds majority to formally amend the Charter under its own rules.
- In 1998, Yasser Arafat held a symbolic assembly with President Clinton present, where participants raised hands to support a letter claiming the offensive articles were nullified—but no formal legal amendment was made.

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has not been formally condemned by the United Nations in a direct resolution. In fact, the UN has historically recognized and engaged with the PLO in several significant ways:

key UN revolutions regarding the PLO

1. Resolution 3210 (1974) – Invited the PLO to participate in General Assembly discussions on the question of Palestine.  
2. Resolution 3236 (1974) – Affirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including self-determination and the right of return.  
3. Resolution 3237 (1974) – Granted the PLO observer status at the United Nations.  
4. Resolution 3375 (1975) – Called for the PLO to participate in peace efforts in the Middle East.  
5. Resolution 43/177 (1988) – Acknowledged the proclamation of the State of Palestine and changed the designation from “PLO” to “Palestine” in the UN system.  
6. Resolution 67/19 (2012) – Upgraded Palestine’s status to a non-member observer state, reaffirming the PLO’s role as its representative.

so can anyone look at this and then say the UN is a non biased in this conflict? i didn't even mention anything too specific so you won't claim ""cherry picking"", like their star they love to show off and defend- the nutjob Francesca albanese",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1m2jcgu/unwatch/,2025-07-17 23:05:09,refugee,25
IsraelPalestine,Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib on what it means to be pro-Palestine,"I thought I'd share this as it's one of the best and most balanced takes on the conflict I've seen.

**What being pro-Palestine means to me / my platform:** I'm passionately, unequivocally, and without hesitation, a proponent of the Palestinian people’s just and urgent aspirations for self-determination, liberation, sovereignty, and safety. I grew up in Gaza, where I experienced Israeli violence and bombardment, including one incident that almost killed me and caused me permanent hearing impairment; my family is still in Gaza and has suffered dozens of deaths during this latest war; my grandparents were expelled from their ancestral homelands in 1948 and fled to the Gaza Strip; and my parents were raised in a refugee camp in Rafah during the 1950s. This background informs and influences me and speaks to why I care about the Palestinian issue and consider myself pro-Palestine. I am motivated by a sincere desire to see my people obtain their legitimate and undeniable rights, which they have not had for decades.  
  
Yet I, and many others, especially those who are silent or are forced to be quiet, struggle with finding a political home in today’s pro-Palestine movement. Increasingly, it feels as if pro-Palestine activism is dominated by maximalists (wanting all of historic Palestine and other zero-sum positions and approaches), slogan-driven voices, and narratives. There is a lack of pragmatic and humanistic ability to hold multiple truths at once and to advocate nuanced and color-rich positions and views that are not black-and-white depictions and understandings of the Israel and Palestine conflict.  
  
**Here’s what, to me, an effective and meaningful pro-Palestine platform entails:**  
  
**1.** Supporting the right of Palestinians to a sovereign and independent state living in peace side by side with Israel.  
  
**2.** Condemning Israeli government actions, policies, priorities, and decisions that kill, harm, undermine, or oppress the Palestinian people.  
  
**3.** Criticizing and decrying the conduct of the war in Gaza, the military occupation in the West Bank, and the Israeli government’s disregard for Palestinian civilian lives, and the destruction of property and cities.  
  
**4.** Rejecting, denouncing, and exposing the theft of Palestinian lands in the West Bank and the sprawling settlement enterprise and settler violence.  
  
**5.** Supporting highly targeted, specific, and effective sanctions against individuals, groups, and entities that are enabling the unjust and illegal occupation of the West Bank and harming Palestinian civilians.  
  
**6.** Denouncing and combating the dehumanization of the Palestinian people or the denial of their existence as people with the right to live on the land they called home for generations.  
  
**7.** Acknowledging the tragedy experienced by hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians from 1948 and giving them/their descendants the right to return to the lands of a future Palestinian state in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.  
  
**8. Understanding past and contemporary mistakes that have set the Palestinian people back by decades and made them pawns in ideologies and geopolitical programs, agendas, and designs.**  
  
**9. Developing a pragmatic and realistic framework for recognizing Israel’s existence, right to exist, and the inevitability of its continued existence, all of which should inform how a solution is approached.**  
  
**10. Dispensing with delusional and destructive elements of the Palestinian narrative and acknowledging that there will not be a full liberation of all of Palestine, there will not be a right of return to what is now mainland Israel, and that Israel cannot and should not be confronted militarily or through any form of violence.**  
  
**11. Promoting a cultural shift away from revolutionary rhetoric, martyrdom, and armed resistance, and instead, rebranding coexistence and peace as a courageous and necessary evolution to preserve Palestinian lives, lands, and heritage and foster a new generation of nation-builders who are focused on doing the most with what the Palestinians currently have and can have in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.**  
  
**12.** Denouncing and rejecting antisemitism while also acknowledging that Zionists and Israelis are a diverse group/people and that the Palestinians have to work with all of these segments to have sustainable coexistence and peace.  
  
**13.** Understanding how violent/hateful rhetoric, actions, and mistakes are detrimental because they empower right-wing and extremist forces in Israel who are opposed to Palestinian rights and that persistent mistakes and incendiary rhetoric and proclamations erode support for the Palestinian people and cause.  
  
**14.** Recognizing Palestinian agency, responsibility, and accountability when taking actions that have negative consequences and outcomes and acknowledging that, while there’s an asymmetry of power dynamics, Palestinian leaders, political groups, and prominent figures should make rational and responsible choices to optimize for better prospects.  
  
**15.** Accepting that even with East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, access to holy sites must always be shared and open to all.  
  
**16.** Realizing how nefarious regional players like the Islamic Republic of Iran and its proxies are not sincere or helpful allies to the Palestinian people and have done so much damage to the entire region and the Palestinian cause.  
  
**17.** Developing the capacity to hear Jewish perspectives and grievances, historical and contemporary, to understand why pro-Israel supporters believe what they do and why Israel means so much to so many, even if one disagrees with those opinions and views.  
  
**18.** Understanding that Hamas recklessly endangered Palestinian lives and placed the people of Gaza in significant harm and that the group relies on Palestinian suffering as part of its strategy to delegitimize Israel globally while perpetuating the conflict without any meaningful resolution.  
  
**19.** Registering the dangers of Islamist rhetoric and ideology that seeks to Islamize Palestinian society and to turn the Palestinian national project into a religious one in pursuit of an Islamic state that, by default, will be exclusionary and incapable of accommodating diverse residents in a future Palestinian country.  
  
I am compelled to share the aforementioned because, for far too many people, pro-Palestine activism has been reduced to incendiary language that fails to capture the multiple moving parts of what is needed to advance the just and urgent Palestinian aspirations for freedom and independence. While many students, activists, advocates, academics, and analysts have their hearts in the right place, many cannot present viable and pragmatic ideas that are not mere rhetorical statements and empty slogans.   
  
I know that many strongly disagree with my views and opinions, and that’s entirely fine. Still, many more are eager to see a recalibration of pro-Palestine activism to actually help the Palestinians achieve statehood instead of inflaming division and fostering hostility towards supporters of Israel and the Jewish community. Many in Palestine are aware of the need to be pragmatic and don’t think that angry protests, BDS, antisemitism, endless academic lectures, social media activism, or “feel good” slogans will actually make a difference.  
  
**It’s time for a rejuvenated pro-Palestine movement that serves as a big tent to encompass multiple views and opinions and to invite and promote broad alliances, especially with mainstream Jewish and Israeli communities, to work towards a just and sustainable resolution of the conflict once and for all. This is entirely attainable and achievable with humility, civility, patience, compassion and kindness, perseverance and determination, a willingness to accept reasonable compromises and accommodations, and, most importantly, the recognition of both sides’ undeniable and mutual humanity.**

IsraelPalestine,A quick history of the conflict where I point out the parts each side ignores,"When hearing a hearing of the conflict, I notice that both Israel and Palestine supporter tend to include about half the information and act like the other half didn't happen. So I'm making this so we can have a full list of what actually happened, including both sides' dirty laundry. I'll point out which stuff each side tends to ignore. If I miss a significant event, post it and relevant context (that means the stuff your the other side did to cause it).

**Ancient times:** Jews lived in ancient Israel and built kingdoms—pro-Palestinians often ignore this.

**Ancient times:** The ancestors of today’s Palestinians (Canaanites, Philistines, Aramaeans) lived in the Levant for millennia—pro-Israelis often ignore this.

**70 CE:** Romans destroy the Second Temple, expel Jews, and enslave and take many to Europe (these slaves become Ashkenazi Jews) and rename the land Palestine, a word that means ""invader"" in Hebrew, to humiliate Jews —pro-Palestinians ignore this

**634 CE:** Arab Muslims expell Jews from Arabia, conquer the Levant, Arabize local populations, and impose second-class dhimmi status on Jews. The ancestors of today’s Palestinians, now Arabized, are part of this sea of Arabs who persecute Jews for the next thousand years. —pro-Palestinians tend to ignore this.

**1516:** Ottomans conquer Palestine; local Arabs live under foreign rule for 400 years—pro-Israelis often ignore this.

**70–1800s:** Jews face repeated massacres, pogroms, expulsions, and legal discrimination throughout Europe and the Muslim world, including expulsions from Arabia, Spain, England, etc. and attacks in Ottoman Palestine. Israel remains the only home they ever had, while they are forced to wander as unwanted foreigners for centuries—pro-Palestinians often ignore this

**Late 1800s:** Zionism emerges as a Jewish national movement seeking return to Israel in response to antisemitism; Jews begin migrating to Ottoman Palestine —pro-Palestinians often portray this as European colonialism, ignoring the Jews are persecuted refugees who are indigenous to the Levant, and that Jews move to be subjects under Ottoman rule, not rulers themselves

**Early 1900s:** As empires fall, nationalistic movements (mostly local ethnic groups wanting to rule themselves rather than live under empires) start around the world. Arab nationalism rises with ambitions for control over the entire Arab world, including the Middle East and North Africa, while Jewish nationalism (Zionism) focuses on establishing a Jewish homeland in a small part of that region—historic Israel/Palestine. Both Arabs and Jews develop competing national identities that increasingly clash over the same land.

**1915–1916:** In the Hussein-McMahon letters, Britain promises Arabs control over most of the Middle East if they revolt against the Ottomans

**1917:** In the Balfour Declaration, Britain promises Jews a national home in Palestine

**1919–1923:** After WWI, the League of Nations grants Britain and France mandates over the Middle East: Arabs gain control over roughly 99.9% of the region (modern-day Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia), while Palestine remains under British mandate

**1920s:** Arab militias start attacking, killing, and displacing Jews regularly. In 1929, Arab mobs massacre 67 Jews in Hebron and expel the rest; similar attacks happen in Safed and Jerusalem. Pro-Palestinians ignore this.

**1930s:** In response to the Arab attacks, Jews  build militias like Irgun and Lehi and retaliate, and you end up with Arab and Jewish militias fighting each other. Pro-Israelis ignore this.

**1941:** The Farhud pogrom in Iraq kills over 180 Jews and injures hundreds; in Palestine, Jews also face violent riots, reflecting wider anti-Jewish sentiment in Arab lands—pro-Palestinians often ignore this wave of anti-Jewish violence.

**1947:** UN proposes partition into Jewish and Arab states; Jews accept, Arabs reject and launch attacks.

**1948:** Israel declares independence; neighboring Arab states (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq) invade. Jordan occupies the West Bank, Egypt takes Gaza. Around 700,000 Palestinians flee or are expelled, while about 850,000 Jews flee or are expelled from Arab countries. Most Israelis today descend from these displaced Middle Eastern/African Jews. Jewish militias massacre Palestinian villagers at Deir Yassin, while Arab forces massacre Jews in places like Kfar Etzion and Gush Etzion. Arab armies besiege Jerusalem, causing starvation for around 100,000 Jews. In the end, Jews control Israel, while Jordan controls the West Bank and Egypt controls Gaza.

**1967:** After weeks of Arab military buildup, Egypt’s closure of Israeli shipping routes, and public threats by Arab leaders to destroy Israel, Israel launches a preemptive strike against Egypt. Jordan, Syria, and Iraq join the war. Israel defeats the Arab forces and captures the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Sinai, and the Golan Heights—pro-Israelis call it occupying the places Arab armies used to attack Israel from, pro-Palestinians call it aggression, occupation, and expansion.

**1973:** On Yom Kippur (the holiest day in Judaism), Egypt and Syria launch a surprise attack on Israel. Israel is initially caught off guard and suffers heavy losses but eventually pushes back both armies

**1979:** Israel signs a peace treaty with Egypt, returning the entire Sinai Peninsula in exchange for recognition and normalized relations

**1987 & 2000:** Two Palestinian uprisings (First and Second Intifadas) involve widespread protests and attacks that result in thousands of Israeli deaths; Israel responds with security measures like checkpoints and barriers, leading to a significant decrease in attacks. Pro-Israelis emphasize wanting to not die in terrorist attacks, while Pro-Palestinians consider these security measures to be apartheid.

**2005:** Israel withdraws settlers and troops from Gaza; after Hamas wins elections and fires rockets at Israeli civilians, Israel imposes a blockade—pro-Israelis say Gaza is self-ruling and Jew-free as Gazans wanted but blockaded for security; pro-Palestinians say it remains under siege and occupation.

**2006–2023:** Hamas launches multiple wars to try and conquer Israel/ kill as many Israeli civilians as possible, Hamas fires rockets targeting civilians, Israeli strikes cause heavy destruction, and more Palestinians than Israelis die in the wars.

**Oct 7, 2023:** Hamas launches a surprise attack on Israel, massacring over 1,200 civilians—burning families alive, shooting children, raping women, and taking hundreds of hostages. It is the deadliest single day for Jews since the Holocaust. Around the world, mass protests erupt—but rather than condemning the massacre, many rallies celebrate it or blame Israel entirely. This marks the first time in history that a massacre was followed by global street protests either celebrating the massacre or condemning the victims, not the attackers. This causes Jews to fear a rise in global antisemitism. Pro-Palestinians tend to downplay or celebrate this, while Pro-Israelis tend focus on how these global celebrations of murdered Jews was a barbarity that had never occurred in history and made the anti-Jewish roots of the Pro-Palestinian movement obvious.

**Present:** Israel invades Gaza in response, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians, including many civilians, and causing a humanitarian crisis. Throughout the war, Hamas and Hezbollah launch tens of thousands of rockets at Israeli cities, while Iran and Yemen fire ballistic missiles—some intercepted by U.S. and Israeli defense systems. Pro-Israelis call it self-defense against terrorism and emphasize Hamas’s use of human shields and low civilian-to-combatant ratios; pro-Palestinians call it genocide and ethnic cleansing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lzzl70/a_quick_history_of_the_conflict_where_i_point_out/,2025-07-14 23:45:47,refugee,8
IsraelPalestine,The UN is undoubtedly biased against Israel and pushes a narrative based on selective outrage.," I'm not making the claim ""Israel is perfect and can do no wrong"". I'm simply stating ""the UN has a clear anti-Israel agenda which it uses its platform to push while failing to address human rights violations in other countries.""

1. The disproportionate amount of UN resolutions 

In 2022 the UN general assembly passed 15 resolutions against Israel, this is more resolutions against a singular country than every other country in the world combined. Russia had 2 passed against it, North Korea 1, Iran 1, Syria 1, and Myanmar 2. All of these countries which received less resolutions combined than Israel have ongoing and well documented human rights abuses. This was before October 7th occurred, I'm aware Palestinians weren't living in fantasy land before that date but the human rights abuses and crimes against humanity being committed by these other countries greatly outnumbered what was being done to Palestinians. I don't make this point to discount the suffering Palestinians have faced, I'm simply questioning why other countries receive not just less but less resolutions combined despite having worse human rights records and ongoing wars.

From 2015 to 2022 the UNGA has passed over 140 resolutions against Israel. Meanwhile only 10 resolutions have been passed against North Korea and 8 against Iran. There is a clear imbalance in resolutions passed against Israel vs other countries that exists year after year. This leads me to believe the UN holds Israel to a different standard than the rest of the world.

2. UNHRC Agenda Item 7

This is a permanent part of every session of the UNHRC titled:  “Human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories

This is the only country specific item at every session. Every session includes a mandatory discussion and review which exclusively focuses on Israel. Every other country is reviewed under Agenda Item 4 which is a general category used for all human rights situations. 
 
3. The UNWRA 
 
Palestinians are the only nationality to have a separate refugee agency, all other global refugees fall under UNHCR. UNWRA also uniquely defines Palestinian refugee status as heritable greatly inflating the number of refugees.   

4. UNESCO denying Jewish history 

The 2016 resolution on Jerusalem referred to both the Temple Mount and Western Wall exclusively by their Muslim names (Al-Haram al-Sharif and Al-Buraq Plaza). The resolution failed to mention the significance of the sites in Judaism while emphasizing Islamic ties to the sites. The Temple Mount is regarded as the holiest site in Judaism and predates any Islamic ties to the site. 

5. Other international forms sponsored by the UN

The WHO annually passes resolutions which single out Israel for health related issues in Palestinian Territories. This wouldn't be an issue if they were actually applying these resolutions to all countries with health related issues. At this point I don't think it needs to be stated that they fail to do this and don't pass nearly as many if any resolutions against countries facing severe health crises such as Syria during its civil war. 

The CSW passed a resolution against Israel in 2021 condemning Israel as the only violator of women's rights. Meanwhile countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia were not even mentioned.

6. Voting Blocs 

Countries often vote with countries they are aligned with and in this case it clearly harms Israel and allows them to push a biased one sided agenda. 

The OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) made up of 57 Muslim Majority countries many of which don't even recognize Israel as a state makes up 29.5 percent of the UN on their own. 

The NAM (non-aligned movement) make up over 120 countries and often vote in line with each other and in favor of pro-Palestinian resolutions like the OIC. 

Together these groups make up 64.2 percent of the UN general assembly. When these two groups coordinate together they can basically pass any resolution they want. Western countries are greatly outnumbered in these voting blocs despite holding much more military power and influence. This often leads to resolutions being passed that are seen as pro-Palestinian without regard to the actual merit of the resolutions.

7. Other specific examples of  ""questionable"" resolutions

Resolution 3379 equated Zionism with racism and was passed in 1975. This resolution was later revoked in 1991 after backlash, but the fact it was able to be passed In the first place is pretty concerning.

General Assembly A/77/400 was a request for the IJC's opinion on Israel's occupation of Palestinian Territories. The resolution did not mention Israeli security concerns, terrorism, or even any context at all for the occupation. The resolution was of course passed with 87 votes in favor. By referring to Israel as an occupying power without any context to why that occupation exists the UN is making negotiations less likely for Israel to actually want to engage in. 

8. Failure to condemn Hamas 

The UN has NEVER passed a resolution condemning Hamas by name. Hamas which fires thousands of rockets at Israeli civilians, has used Human shields (which is literally recognized by the UN itself), uses child soldiers, and regularly commits suicide bombings has not had a single resolution passed against it... 

9. Revisiting point 3. a UN agency is not just looking the other way or failing to condemn Hamas but are actively helping Hamas. The UNWRA has been used by Hamas to store weapons and for other military purposes in the past. For some reason this seems to be controversial despite the overwhelming amount of proof.

Following the war in 2014 Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the use of UNWRA schools for military purposes.

""We condemn the use of United Nations schools by Hamas and other groups to store weapons. This is a flagrant violation…”

UNWRA itself recognizes rockets have been found at their schools (July 26th, 22nd, and 29th 2014)

The 2009 Goldstone Report which documented that Hamas and other armed groups ""stored weapons in mosques"" and ""launched attacks from civilian areas, compromising civilian safety""

A UNHRC inquiry in 2014 concluded Palestinian armed groups ""stored weapons in civilian areas and UNWRA schools and launched attacks from those areas"". This undoubtedly falls under the legal definition of using human shields.
 
Despite all this evidence that the UN itself found that Hamas uses human shields and the known terrorist attacks it commits the United Nations General Assembly and Human Rights Council have never passed a resolution explicitly condemning Hamas by name for these actions.

In my opinion it's pretty undeniable the UN has a systemic anti-Israel bias. The UN is not some neutral forum where countries vote fairly and happen to only pass resolutions against Israel. This is not about denying Palestinian suffering. This is about a global forum being hijacked to push a one sided narrative that fails to recognize Israeli suffering and the suffering of others across the world which has helped create plausible deniability for Hamas.

IsraelPalestine,"“Free Palestine” No, no one truly cares. They just hate israel.","1. Israel is not going to stop going after Hamas just because they hide behind civilians, it is a job that must be done. 

2. If you care about the civilians of gaza, maybe ask the surrounding arab and muslim nations why they are not taking in gazan’s refugees? There have been around 6 million ukraine refugees. But very few people have left gaza since the war. If millions of civilians fled gaza, a lot less civilians would have to die if any.

“The Defense”- People say that they can’t do that because then israel would win the land. It’s funny how people care more about a piece of “land” over people and children dying, they happily sacrifice children blood for political gain. 

I could go on for eternity with all the problems in this conflict. For one international war only works when both sides are following it. Israel does it best to follow it and keep civilians safe but when you are fighting a terrorist group that has zero regard of human life and international law you can’t expect isreal to follow it perfectly. And don’t get me started on the “so called genocide”. If israel is trying to commit a genocide, they are the worse genociders in all of human history. 2 years and only about 60k killed? And they often warn people when they are about to drop bombs? very friendly genociders.


People want israel to let Hamas “Off the hook”. They don’t understand nor care that after hamas is let go, they will just go back to rebuilding their military and commit october 7 again and agin and possible an even more deadlier attack. Israel is not going to “wait” for another disaster to happen to try to defend against it. They are going to go after the threat and destroy it.

Conclusion: Ask the arab and muslim countries why they are not taking in refugees to save civilians, target your anger towards them and hamas. But don’t expect the IDF to stop attacking gaza to destroy hamas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lriz65/free_palestine_no_no_one_truly_cares_they_just/,2025-07-04 15:38:48,refugee,137

IsraelPalestine,The crimes allegedly committed by Israel in 1948 are no longer relevant in 2025.,"I'm not going to get into a discussion about whether there were any war crimes in the 1948 War of Independence, because that's not the purpose of the discussion, and as I stated in the title, it's already irrelevant in 2025. I believe that there were indeed war crimes here and there (as in almost every war)

Therefore, I will begin the discussion with the hypothesis that there were indeed war crimes.

The presentation of Israeli war crimes as proof of Israel's illegitimacy is pathetic. If we already point out that Israel was established in 1948, it is literally 3 years since the end of World War II...

Is Germany presented as an illegitimate state because of the former Nazi regime? After all, dozens of regimes have already passed since then, and so has Israel. The party that ruled Israel in 1948 is now a small party with barely 4 seats.

Although if you want to discuss current Israeli policy, no problem, but don't bring events from 77 years ago into the discussion...

It's as stupid as trying to criticize Germany's policies because they were Nazis...

And even if you try to link the Nakba to the expulsion of the Palestinians, the Germans were also expelled from the Sudetenland, and no one treats them as refugees anymore.

The Palestinians need to move on and stop digging into history. It's time for a new history.

  
Important note:Please don't deviate from the discussion. Because pro-Palestinians have a tendency to mention the genocide every time they lose an argument... The discussion is not currently about genocide.

IsraelPalestine,"OPINION FROM A DUTCHIE: Palestine: Not a State, but a Political Instrument of Radical Regimes","Over the years, I’ve spent a great deal of time trying to truly understand the Israeli–Palestinian conflict — not just through headlines, but by digging deeper into history, regional politics, and the broader ideological forces at play. I’m not religious, nor do I identify strongly with the political left or right — I’m simply someone seeking justice and truth.

It’s a subject that’s often presented in black and white, but the truth is far more complex. In this piece, I want to share my perspective — a view shaped by facts, context, and years of questioning. I hope it helps others see the conflict from a different angle, and perhaps encourages more critical thought about the roles played by various actors in this long-standing struggle.


🔹 1. Palestine: Never a Sovereign State
	•	Historically, “Palestine” has been a region, not a nation. For centuries it was ruled by larger empires such as the Ottoman Empire and later the British Mandate (1920–1948).
	•	There has never been a sovereign Palestinian state with defined borders, currency, or an independent government.


🔹 2. Even Arab Control Didn’t Lead to a Palestinian State
	•	After Israel’s founding in 1948, the Gaza Strip came under Egyptian control, and the West Bank was annexed by Jordan.
	•	During those 19 years (1948–1967), neither Egypt nor Jordan made any effort to establish a Palestinian state.
	•	That opportunity was there — and yet it was ignored. This reveals that even Arab states did not prioritize Palestinian sovereignty when they had the chance.


🔹 3. Multiple Peace Offers Rejected

Palestinian leaders have rejected several real opportunities to create their own state:
	•	1947 – UN Partition Plan: Rejected by the Arab League; five Arab armies attacked Israel.
	•	2000 – Camp David: Israel offered nearly the entire West Bank and shared Jerusalem. Arafat said no.
	•	2008 – Olmert Proposal: Even more generous; again rejected.

Time and again, it became clear: the creation of a Palestinian state is less important than the refusal to recognize Israel.


🔹 4. Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran: Destruction over Coexistence
	•	Hamas, since its founding in 1987, has had one clear goal: the destruction of Israel. This is stated plainly in its original charter.
	•	Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen follow the same pattern.
	•	All are funded, trained and ideologically fueled by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)—an organization whose motto includes “Death to America, Death to Israel.”
	•	In this worldview, Palestine is a tool, not a cause. The ultimate goal is the elimination of Israel.


🔹 5. Why Arab Nations Never Truly Helped the Palestinians

While many Arab leaders claim to support the Palestinians, history shows a different reality:
	•	After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled to Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait.
	•	Yet they were denied citizenship, rights and integration for decades.
	•	Why?
	1.	Political leverage: As long as Palestinians remained refugees, they could be used as a weapon against Israel.
	2.	Demographic fear: Fully integrating them would upset sectarian and ethnic balances within those states.
	3.	Instability: Palestinian militant groups often caused armed conflict in host countries.

Examples of conflict with Arab countries:
	•	Jordan – Black September (1970–71):
The PLO built a military base in Jordan and launched attacks on Israel. Fearing a coup, King Hussein ordered a brutal crackdown. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed or deported.
	•	Lebanon – Civil War & Sabra and Shatila (1975–1982):
The PLO moved to Lebanon and became embroiled in the civil war. In 1982, Christian militias attacked Palestinian refugee camps, killing 800–3000 civilians. Israel, overseeing the area, was held indirectly responsible.
	•	Kuwait – After the Gulf War (1991):
Many Palestinians openly supported Saddam Hussein during his occupation of Kuwait. After liberation, over 200,000 Palestinians were expelled or persecuted.

The idea of “Arab brotherhood” collapses when faced with these facts.


🔹 6. The Refugee Narrative: Root Causes and Mythmaking
	•	The Palestinian refugee crisis is often blamed solely on Israel. However, the truth is more complex:
	•	In 1948, Israel accepted a two-state solution.
	•	Arab states launched a war against the new Jewish state and urged Palestinians to flee temporarily, expecting a swift victory.
	•	The resulting refugee crisis — known as the “Nakba” — was a consequence of Arab aggression, not a unilateral Israeli expulsion.

Even today, Palestinian refugees are denied resettlement by Arab nations so their status can continue to be used as political ammunition.


🔹 7. Palestinians as Pawns in a Larger Ideological War
	•	Instead of building institutions, infrastructure, or civil society, Hamas has invested billions in rockets, terror tunnels, and propaganda.
	•	After Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, the territory could have become a peaceful, self-governed state. Instead, it became a military stronghold where civilians are used as human shields.
	•	Meanwhile, international media continues to portray Israel as the sole aggressor — ignoring the internal sacrifice imposed by Hamas on its own people.


🔹 8. What About “Genocide”?

Some call Israel’s actions genocide — but that doesn’t add up. Gaza has 2.3 million people living in an extremely densely populated area. After months of war, around 55,000 deaths have been reported, of which 20,000 were Hamas fighters (IDF estimate). Meanwhile, about 70% of Gaza’s buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged.

If Israel truly intended to wipe out the population, the numbers would be far higher.

So how is it possible that so many people are still alive despite such destruction? Because Israel warns civilians through flyers, phone calls and text messages before targeting Hamas sites — something unprecedented in modern warfare.

Moreover, Hamas hides in tunnels, beneath homes, hospitals and schools, making it incredibly difficult to target terrorists without civilian risk. This is not genocide — this is a tragic but precise war against a terror group, not a people.


🔹 Conclusion

The myth of Palestine as a victimized, aspiring nation survives through emotion, selective outrage, and political narratives. But the historical and geopolitical reality shows a different picture: the Palestinian cause has been exploited for decades by radical regimes, jihadist movements, and Arab leaders who had no real interest in peace.

Iran and its proxies don’t care about Palestinian sovereignty. They care about Israel’s destruction, and the Palestinians remain a pawn in that broader campaign.

As long as Palestinian leadership and its supporters value violence over statehood, and destruction over coexistence, peace will remain impossible. The international community must face this reality and stop enabling the ideological manipulation of the Palestinian people.

🔹 Final Thought

As harsh as it may seem, Israel is the greatest friend the Palestinian people have — even if many fail to see it. While their own leaders and surrounding regimes exploit them, only Israel has shown both the military restraint and long-term willingness to coexist and build peace.

At the same time, I’m deeply concerned about the West’s growing blindness, especially among well-meaning leftist movements. The surge in pro-Palestinian protests — often loud, emotional, and one-sided — shows how easily public opinion can be manipulated. Many fail to see the bigger picture: radical Islam doesn’t just use the Palestinian cause, it weaponizes emotion, and the West is falling for it. With good intentions, many are unknowingly defending forces that stand against freedom, equality, and human rights.

The brutal actions of Iran’s regime against its own people alone should be enough to understand the true nature of Islamism in the Middle East and why resistance against it is necessary. Yet, despite the overwhelming facts—often twisted or ignored by the media and public discourse—I simply cannot understand why so many refuse to take the time to truly understand this conflict, instead choosing to blindly shout “Free Palestine” without grasping the complexities involved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lnne8x/opinion_from_a_dutchie_palestine_not_a_state_but/,2025-06-29 21:33:51,refugee,91
IsraelPalestine,"you don't care about ""nakba"" refugee","let's start with this again:

Constantin Zureiq coined the term ""Nakba"" in 1948, he meant it as a deep critique of the Arab world’s failure during the war over Palestine. In his book Ma'na al-Nakba (The Meaning of the Disaster), he described the Arab defeat not just as a military loss, but as a civilizational setback. He believed the Arab states had been unprepared, disorganized, and overconfident, and that their failure to prevent the establishment of Israel revealed deeper problems in Arab society—like a lack of modern institutions, unity, and strategic thinking.

So originally, Zureiq wasn’t just mourning the loss of Palestinian land—he was calling for a serious reckoning within the Arab world. He wanted people to understand that the catastrophe was not only what happened to Palestine, but what it revealed about the state of the Arab nations at the time.

the pro Palestinian propaganda changed it's meaning to divert attention about the war and make it about refugees, but even then it's not about refugees...

pro ""Palestinians"" with  narratives don't really care about the ""nakba"" refugees, let's first try to think what would caring about refugees mean, normally it would mean caring about their well being, do they have a home? are they safe from war? are they getting by financially?

these aren't the concerns of the pro ""Palestinians"", they want to throw the Palestinians to war instead, homes?
they don't if they have homes in developed countries in Europe or the USA or more stable arab countries.

they want them to have homes specifically next to the ""evil demoniac zionists"" that they love to demonize so much or they want them remove the ""Zionists"" entirely in brutal conflict they call ""resistance"" and ""freedom fighting""

has the pro Palestinians ever comcerned themselves with the rights of the Palestinians outside of Palestine?

because it doesn't look good...

- Lebanon: Palestinians are denied citizenship and face restrictions in employment, property ownership, and access to public services. They're barred from working in many skilled professions like medicine, law, and engineering. Many live in refugee camps with limited infrastructure and rights.

- Syria: Before the civil war, Palestinians had more rights than in other Arab countries, but the conflict changed that. Camps like Yarmouk were devastated, and many Palestinians were displaced again. Some were detained or disappeared during the war, and access to aid has been inconsistent.

- Jordan: While many Palestinians have Jordanian citizenship, those from Gaza or without proper documentation face discrimination. Some are denied access to public education, healthcare, and government jobs.

- Egypt: Palestinians often face bureaucratic hurdles, especially in travel and residency. They may be denied entry or face long delays at border crossings like Rafah. Access to education and work can also be limited.

These issues are tied to the political context, arabic governments fear that granting full rights might undermine the Palestinian right of return

now do pro ""Palestinians"" want Palestinians to be safe from war?

of course not! 

they encourage Palestinians to go to war instead:

how is unrwa definition of refuegees different from UNHCR?(the agency for all other refugees around he world)

UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) defines a Palestinian refugee as someone whose normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1, 1946, and May 15, 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict. Crucially, this status is passed down to descendants, including legally adopted children.

This is different from the definition used by UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), which generally does not automatically extend refugee status to descendants across generations. UNHCR focuses on finding durable solutions like resettlement, local integration, or voluntary repatriation.

So, while UNHCR aims to resolve refugee status over time, UNRWA’s mandate is more about providing ongoing support to a specific population until a political solution is found. That’s why the number of registered Palestinian refugees has grown over the decades, even though many were born outside of historic Palestine.

that is why cities in gaza and the west bank are called ""refugee centers"", (of course they aren't taking any refugees).

these sentiment is also shared by the pan-arab colonist(""Palestinians"") themselves:

what do the ""Palestinians"" actually fight for?

if it's land then i don't know what it could possibly be, we can't try negating some:

is it about security?

nope, they always refuse peace deals, they started the conflict in the first place.

in the way they are ""freedom fighting"" their priorities are transparent- they don't care about defending civiliansz at best they defend hamas commanders and weapon stashes, the rest are expendible ""martyrs""

they encourage suicide bombings and similar attacks, every time they get their ass beaten after a war they start, they pretend they won, like hamas did in the last ceasefire despite the absurd ratio difference in the casualties between the sides.

here is what the government of gaza has to say:

https://youtu.be/vgVT2M9otRU?feature=shared

Sami Abu Zuhri, head of Hamas Political Department Abroad, said in a March 30, 2025 interview with Al-Tanasuh TV (Libya) that the story of Gaza is far bigger than the number of martyrs or the destruction of homes. He stated that at least 50,000 babies were born in Gaza during the war, matching the number of those killed. “Did you know that the number of newborn babies in Gaza equals the number of martyrs who were killed in this war?” he asked.



Abu Zuhri said that the war with Israel is “eternal” and called it a historic and unprecedented battle. He claimed the impact of the war extends beyond Gaza and the region, citing anti-Israel protests on U.S. campuses and people in the U.S. and Europe converting to Islam. He said that students are demanding the liberation of Palestine “from the River to the Sea” and rejecting the existence of the State of Israel. “The story is much bigger,” Abu Zuhri said, and claimed that the issue is not “about 100 destroyed houses or 1,000 martyrs,” adding: “They are the price we need to pay.”

so we can conclude this conflict isn't about refugees, it's about land.

now if the question is about which land are we talking about exactly, then the answer is not the west bank and gaza as i have shown before, it's about the entirely of Palestine, always has been...

with that, i yield back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lmlr7i/you_dont_care_about_nakba_refugee/,2025-06-28 14:34:23,refugee,49
IsraelPalestine,no whataboutism,"it feels like almost all posts here are criticism against israel but this war has two sides...

the main tactic of the pro ""Palestinian"" narrative from day one is to attack, never defend- this reflects the ""Palestinian""/pan-arab strategy in past wars with israel and the Palestinian conflict, they only attack- fire rockets, RPGs, booby trap their own homes, etc, but they have never done anything to defend themselves, the tunnels defend their weapon stashes, they aren't even defending hamas since hamas are expandable ""martyrs"" along with all the other ""Palestinians"".

so the narrative is to shift the focus from October 7, from hamas to israel- right now most pro ""Palestinian"" propaganda agents even act as if Hamas don't exist, like they are eradicated, that's why the main narrative turned into- ""IsRaEL iS FiGhTiNg BabiEs!"", as if hamas isn't actively fighting the IDF maybe specifically right now they are more busy playing victim, but during the last ""ceasefire"" in late march they immediately showed up in their military uniforms started a military parade while claiming complete ""victory"" and hamas officials vowed to repeat October 7 again and again, so if israel stops now who's to say this event won't repeat?

seems very likely.

it's the easiest thing to play victim when you are losing but i, as person who wasn't born yesterday and witnessed October 7 and the reactions to it from their groups in telegram and hamas, Hezbollah official posting, i can say it was crystal clear they were deluded enough to think they were actually gonna win, hamas officials(most are dead) like Muhammad deif proudly stated how they are coming to liberate ""al quds"" and other similar statements from their leaders, only when they started to realize it's another war on the long list that the pan-arab groups lost against israel they began their compaign of playing victim and even denying their own crimes they filmed and boasted about.
(another example is the conflict with iran and the support Iran gets for targeting civilians)

right now the main narrative evolved into mirroring whatever is happening in gaza to the Holocaust, so they can dillute the Holocaust further by engaging in comparisons and trying to make ""zionists"" downplay the Holocaust, all so they can remove the Holocaust card from the jews which is a key factor in Zionism.
(of course it won't work since it's not even close, this is an active war, hamas can always choose to surrender, ghettos were jews stayed alive were only for the purpose of putting them to work, there aren't IDF soldiers making gazans do work in gaza or anything close to that, we have full capabilities of exterming the gazans if we wanted to, etc)

one of requirements for the Palestinian ""historical"" narrative to work is holocaust denial, could be plain holocaust denial, or more elusive, for example:

by making accusations of askenazis making deals with nazi germans regarding palestine and similar stuff without context to make the reader ""connect the dots"" with a false conclusion.

this is required because this way they can paint a picture of ""white colonizers coming to colonize Palestine"" and not one of the biggest ethnic cleansing of jews that forced mass immigration to Palestine, so it's not a coincidence that the first immigration waves were from antisemic countries from Europe and from russia.

only after israel was formed and along with it the rage of the pan-arab nations that began the mass immigrations of jews from the middle east to israel, this is a simple action-reaction.

of course i don't even have to make that point to justify israel existence, because israel made every legal step to form their state regardless of how jews migrated to israel, israel tried to co-exist with the neighboring pan-arab countries, the conflict is not because israel failed in trying to co-exist with them, it's because a country of jews in the middle east was simply unacceptable for them.

the following war in 1948 was the what they usually consider the start of the conflict, the war they started disobeying international law(UN resolution of the partition plan) which is funny how they love international law only when it benefits them.

so according to the pro Palestinians during that war was an event called the ""nakba""- which they define as the mass ""ethnic cleansing"" of around 800k ""Palestinians""(let's ignore the fact that refugees in war is common, especially in wars where territory is lost and some of the Palestinians evacuated on their own on the arab armies orders).

the actual term ""nakba"" was coined by an arab and it had a different meaning, the devastating humiliating loss of the Arab armies in the war, the pro Palestinian propaganda changed it's meaning to divert attention about the war and make it about refugees, but even then it's not about refugees, it's about land, since Arab had enough land to give the refugees a home(which would normally remove their refugee label) it's about the loss of land and it still what it's all comes down to in the Palestinian goal of their wars.

this was all just examples of pro Palestinian narrative strategies of diverting any wrong doings of Palestinians(hamas never being mentioned, diluting the Holocaust, changing the ""nakba"" meaning, etc) and ""attack"" the israeli policies so my main point is that pro Palestinians never defend, only attack.

it's very common to see whataboutism when someone criticize hamas or someone from the pro Palestinian side, but let's see you try answering the difficult questions WITHOUT WHATABOUTISM:

1. when the 1948 war ended with jordan ruling the west bank and Egypt rulling gaza(the exact borders of palestine, right? lol) till 1967, why wasn't there an attempt to make a Palestinian state?

2. during those same years 1948-1967 there wasn't an attempt to form a Palestinian state besides a Palestinian ""nationality"" group- the PLO in 1964, a terrorist group that attacked israel when there was no ""apartheid""/""blockade""/""genocide""on the west bank or gaza(at least not by israel lol, and I'm not saying there rver was one by israel), so why did they do it when they had what they currently claim to want? could it be related to these common slogans- ""from the river to the sea"", ""free Palestine""?

now i don't expect anyone to actually give me a serious answer because i have got one by asking these questions, so I'll just further destroy the ""Palestinian"" narrative: 

assuming i proved that ""Palestine"" was never about the west bank or gaza, but about removing jews from the middle east, isn't it interesting how the Palestinian narrative put importance on the refugee issue, for example, UNRWA perpetuates eternal refugee status for the Palestinians(it is inherited by children, most gazans are considered refugees for generations, cities are called refugee camps- they aren't taking in refugees lol) so the conflict continues until they gain back ""their land""(again assume that ""their land"" isn't just the west bank and gaza) doesn't that make UNRWA goals completely aligned with hamas?

so I'll finish with this

IsraelPalestine,Wars and Population Transfers in the 1940s Were Not Unique Or Historic Injustices,"In the 1940s, a nation was attacked and almost exterminated by its neighbor. But, thanks for perseverance and partisan warfare, some of which got ugly, the nation was able to defeat the neighbor in war and as a result of the war, took a large amount of that neighbor's territory and expelled hundreds of thousands of the neighbor's nation from that territory. Today, that ""stolen"" territory remains part of the nation.

But I'm not talking about Israel and the Palestinians. I'm talking about Poland and Germany. 

After WWII, Poland was granted large swathes of German territory by the Allies, as determined in the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. Specifically, from the former western border of Poland all the way to the  Oder–Neisse line. The territory was home to millions of Germans, and [they were all expelled.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%931950)) A Communist leader of Poland at the time, Wladyslaw Gomulka, said, ""We have to throw them out."" According to Wikipedia, ""The territories Poland annexed had been ruled as part of Poland by the Piast dynasty in the High Middle Ages,"" which I found interesting. 

And yet, despite this occurrence, no one considers Poland a ""colonizer"" state built on ""stolen land."" The millions of Germans expelled were not kept in refugee camps for 75 years while their leaders whined and complained about a great injustice being done to them and demanding a return to Poland. No one considers Poland to be born in sin or an illegitimate state. 

I'm sure by now you see the parallel. My point is not to justify the Nakba, but simply to point out that countries losing territories and populations moving was not an unusual occurrence in the 1940s. India and Pakistan are another example of this occurring. The actual events of the Nakba are not unique, and they are not some great stain on Israel's soul. Israel's existence is not forever tainted and made illegitimate by the Nakba any more than these other countries were by the circumstances of their creation/recreation. 

What is unique about the Nakba is the REACTION. No other country attempted to rewrite history to make itself the blameless victim who never did anything wrong. No other country forced their refugees into camps for decades, refusing to integrate them into their societies and promising them that ""someday"" they'll ""return"". Germany and India accepted the loss of territory they perceived as theirs (for the most part) and didn't use the refugees as political pawns. The Arab League, by treating the Palestinian refugees uniquely through forcing them to remain in refugee camps for decades and indoctrinating them to believe that they had a right to go to where they used to live (a right no other nation, including the ones who experienced fairly identical circumstances to the Palestinian Arabs at the same time in history, has), has created a huge problem where none needed to exist. But you don't have to take my word for it. You can take the word of Lt General Alexander Galloway, UNRWA rep to Jordan, who said, [""The Arab states do not want to solve the refugee problem. They want to keep it as an open sore, as an affront to the United Nations and as a weapon against Israel. Arab leaders don't give a damn whether the refugees live or die.""](https://www.romirowsky.com/7948/a-tale-of-two-galloways)

It's time for Palestine to act like post-war Germany and admit its defeat, accept its losses, and move on, and that means it and its Arab allies are the ones who need to deal with the refugee problem in a humane way, not Israel. For the good of its own nation and humanity. It's the only way the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can actually ever be resolved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lig85l/wars_and_population_transfers_in_the_1940s_were/,2025-06-23 15:12:02,refugee,26
IsraelPalestine,"Churchill was a war criminal, committed genocide against the German people","The poor German people, after World War I (1918), Germany was in a difficult economic situation:



Defeated in the war.



Obliged to pay heavy reparations under the Treaty of Versailles (1919).



Loss of important territories and resources.



Early 1920s - Severe economic crisis:



In 1923 there was hyperinflation - money lost its value completely.



People carried bags of money to buy bread.



Unemployment, hunger and political instability were widespread.



Late 1920s - Partial recovery:



Programs such as the Dose Plan and the Young Plan helped stabilize the economy through American loans.



The Great Depression (1929) - Global economic collapse:



The US stopped economic aid.



Germany sank back into mass unemployment (millions unemployed).



Factories collapsed and poverty worsened. Germany was subject to a terrible famine, therefore, they formed a Nazi ""resistance"" movement against the European aggression that robbed France of its coal mines. During World War II, the Allies attacked civilian targets, killing a million German citizens, including women and children. We will therefore add the order of the war criminal Winston Churchill to bomb Dresden, a civilian target! Harming 25,000 civilians!



The war crimes did not end there. The Germans suffered ethnic cleansing when more than two million Germans were expelled from the Sudetenland. Germany was under Russian occupation for decades.



Now I demand that all German refugees be returned to the Sudetenland, to correct In some way the injustice done to them.

Does this rhetoric sound familiar to you? It's a good thing the pro-Palestinians didn't live during World War II.

IsraelPalestine,Myth: Israel Population Mostly Holocaust Refugees,"I find the following numbers factual and persuasive evidence that helps disprove the antisemitic argument that Israel is a European-white-colonial-project mixed with a Holocaust-Survivor-pity-state. 

Post-1948, Arab countries expelled more Jews (850,000) than Israel took in Holocaust Refugees (350,000). There weren’t many to take in, you know, on account of the N-z- policy of murdering us all. 

Here is a brief overview of the numbers.

Before 1948, 650,000 Jews already lived in the land, many from migrations going back to the 1880s (the Yishuv). https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-population-of-israel-1948-present

You might ask: well, if Israel wasn’t primarily a Holocaust refugee state, how many Jews did it take in and from where and how do you account for the majority of the population?

As mentioned, only 350,000 Holocaust survivors immigrated to Israel after WWII. This is a significant number, but not the majority of Israel’s early Jewish population.
Yad Vashem: https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/remembrance/immigration.asp 

In fact, when looking at sizable Jewish migrant figures, you’ll find the aforementioned fact that 850,000 Jews were expelled from or fled  Arab and Muslim countries (Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Iran) between 1948–1970 due to the formation of Israel. This is more than double the Holocaust refugees Israel took in. 

World Jewish Congress: https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/jews-from-arab-countries-and-iran
JIMENA: https://www.jimena.org/jimena-advocacy/jewish-refugees-from-arab-countries/

Between the pre-existing Israelis and the MENA region refugees, Israel was never simply a “European colonial project.” It was the return of an ancient people (a great number of them from the Middle East) to their ancestral homeland, much of it purchased piece by piece.

What do you think about these numbers? What questions might you have about them?

Edit: this is one of several arguments that disprove the settler colonial framing and by no means the only one. For a brief summary, please see this list I wrote: [Ten Reasons Why Israel is not a Settler Colonial State](https://snailaskwhy.com/2024/11/21/10-reasons-why-israel-is-not-a-settler-colonial-state/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lep7fd/myth_israel_population_mostly_holocaust_refugees/,2025-06-18 20:49:56,refugee,71
IsraelPalestine,"The Laws of War Apply to All. Yes, Iran too. And Hamas.","The law of armed conflict (LOAC) is based on three fundamental principles - non aggression, distinction, and proportionality. 

We often hear that Israel must adhere to these principles, and it does. But when it comes to Hamass, Hezbollah, or the evil terror state Iran - we rarely see these principles being discussed. 

We’re reminded that this is the 21st century and that the rules are the rules. And israel follows the rules. But does this rhetoric “this is not world war 2” and “we need to act in accordance with evolved norms” ever come up when talking about hamas? 

Of course not. 

Some background: 

The principles of distinction and nonaggression are old, going back centuries. While the definition of a legitimate military target had changed, the idea that some people may be targeted while others cannot goes back thousands of years. The same goes for the rule of nonaggression. Everyone intuitively understands, from a young age - “he started it” is a valid point. Self defense is a fundamental principle that also goes back centuries. 

Proportionality is a new concept. Indeed, the Geneva Conventions don’t explicitly mention “proportionality”. Indeed, prior to their inception- wars were decidedly fought in a disproportionate manner. 

To illustrate, during the war, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) had once launched a raid against the German port city of Hamburg, citing military necessity. The British destroyed entire blocks in what we would today call “carpet bombing”, killing thousands of Germans in a single day. 

British generals reported that a single postal office remained standing and that a large number of German refugees gathered there after the bombing because the entire neighborhood was otherwise burning. 

The British government decided to bomb the postal office, citing military necessity. Postal services are a fundamental function of the war effort, and hence destroying the office was going to further disrupt the Nazi communication system.

A day after destroying an entire city block in Hamburg, the RAF killed the survivors of the previous days’ bombing in the postal office, citing the necessity to disrupt the Nazi war related mail service. 

This would be an example of a disproportional attack today. 

The Geneva Conventions were ratified to prevent such things from happening. Indeed, since the 1950s, the British and Americans have increasingly incorporated precision weapons to target military targets while minimizing collateral damage. 

Militaries have been increasingly paying heed to the idea of proportionality. 

The standards have evolved. 

It is no longer considered appropriate to bomb an entire refugee camp just because there is a single communication center there, the way the RAF did in Hamburg (and the Americans too, not to mention the Soviets). 

Indeed, Israel internalized these principles, just like the other western countries.

Today, we no longer use such tactics. 

But do we apply the same logic to methods of irregular warfare? 

The looney left and the alt right do not. They cite “international law” all the time, but they know nothing about it. 

They claim, Hamas may use hospitals, mosques, and churches to hide from the IDF because that’s how “resistance” works. That’s how the Vietcong operated. And, you know, the Vietcong were the good guys… right??

No. 

Not right. 


The LOAC is clear and applies to all. Just like the requirement to refrain from bombing an ENTIRE refugee camp, knowingly, just to hit a single mail box is now considered inappropriate, by the same token - “resistance” methods like kidnapping aid trucks, extortion, not wearing uniforms, hiding in schools, hiding in hospitals and all the other famous perfidious tactics by hamas are ILLEGAL. 

Israel adheres to the rules. 

Does hamas? 

It doesn’t. 

We hear from the looney left and the alt right all the time- “hamas is a resistance group.” and “Israel violates international law”. 

But that is meaningless coming from people who defend Hamas’ right to fight without wearing uniforms, from hospitals, residential areas, from schools, and from refugee camps. 

The duty to fight in accordance with the law extends to hamas. And the duty of those who incessantly cite “international law” (something they know literally nothing about) is to be neutral, respectful, and honest.

IsraelPalestine,The 1982 seige of Beirut and total victory. What historical perspective can tell us about the way to peace.,"My central point here is that people on both sides often miss the forest for the trees. Total victory, in the total destruction/isolation of popular Palestinian factions is fundamentally fruitless  and will not bring stability/security to anyone in the region. 

As we hyperfocus on day by day events we lose sight of the underlying causes and different interests that led us here. Unless we solve these contrasts their can never be sustainable peace. 

To illustrate this I wanted to point to a specific event, or rather moment in time: the 1982 seige of Beirut and subsequent ""total israeli victory"" and I try to draw parallels to the wars today. 

First, for the important wider context. Soviet influence/interest in the region had greatly wained and in 1982 Lebanon remained the sole base for any real Palestinian national movements, and housed the largest; the PLO(Fateh). By the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon the Palestinian movement had lost its biggest centres of material support. Jordan had expelled the Palestinian factions following Black September,  Iran and Iraq were fighting debilitating wars with one another, the gulf was firmly US aligned, and Jamal abdelnasser was replaced by the Camp-david-signing Anwar Sa'adat. Beirut was very much the last stand. The West Bank and Gaza too, were largely totally repressed and dormant despite diaspora palestinians best effort. 

Then the invasion and seige came. To israelis, this was about finally ending the threat they saw in the radical palestinian factions. Expelling the terrorists from their borders once and for all and allowing for complete Israeli dominance over the entire region. 

They cut off food, water, and all supplies to the city. They funded/created/armed local factions, to fight on their behalf and entered with overwhelming force all in an effort to pressure the Palestinian groups to leave and effectively surrender. Im sure many can already see the obvious parallels to today.

Importantly though, it ""worked"". Yasser Arafat took the decision to capitulate, practically admit defeat and move the PLO to Tunis, 3000km away. After agreeing with the US on guarantees for the safety of the Palestinian civilians left behind, he evacuated on a Greek ship along with the overwhelming majority of his fighters. Immediately following this, Israel carried out mass arrests over the entirety of south Lebanon and it's palestinian refugee camps. Then, along with the phalangist forces it helped prop up and create in the first place, massacred the refugee camps now empty of most its weapons and ""fighting aged"" men.

For many this is seen as the end of an era and wider umbrella of movements in the Middle East/levant. The socialist(ish), arab nationalist radicals of the 20th century were practically all defeated and pacified. Their remained no credible near-term threat to Israeli domination from the PLO, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, gulf, or even Syria. And I assume it must have felt like an almost history-ending mmoment. For both many Palestinians and Israelis it was seen as a crucial Israeli victory. The same, in fact, can be said for the 36-39 war, the Nakba in 48 and the 6 day war. 

Yet, we know now just how wrong they were. The First intifadha(popular revolt) blew up a few years later, followed by the second, then by the Gaza disengagement. This all culminated in a marked rise in ""islamist""(its a silly term but that isn't the topic of this post) groups and influence. Yes we had the eventual (almost) total disarming of the PLO whilst the accompanying PFLP fell almost into obscurity. Yes we had the peace treaties with numerous other arab states and the massive expansion of settlements. But fundamentally it didn't achieve the pacification of the Palestinian people, instead it ended with the most violent attack on Israel since its founding. Total victory here, just as it would be today, was a total lie.

So, I'm not going to claim to know what's going to happen in the next year or so. Perhaps Israel succeeds in completely isolating Hamas from its allies as it did for Fateh, perhaps it ends all anti-US regimes in the region. It might even succeed in ending any and all threats from Islamist factions just as it did for the arab nationalist. 

On the other hand perhaps it has underestimated the size of its enemies just as it did in Oct 7th. Perhaps theirs a coup/uprising in Egypt or Jordan. Maybe Pakistan decides its current relationship with the US is no longer good enough. Or any other group/ideology eventually grows in prominence and takes up the ""anti-imperial/US mantle"" .

We always seem to be just one more war away from Israeli security. Israel just needs to overthrow this one last regime then it'll have security. It's sissyphus and the rock up the hill.

Their are fundamental reasons why these groups exist. Hamas, just like Fateh, or the IRGC were born in, and grew as a result of a desire for independence, and sovereignty in their homelands, that every people holds. Whether through popular uprisings, great marches of return, or guerilla warfare all people devoid of their own dignity and freedom will fight for it, often to the death. In the words of American revolutionaries ""Give me liberty of give me death"".  I think Jewish zionists are probably  the most understanding of this fundamental desire for collective freedom and control over their own lives. 

It is my belief, that destroying military capabilities and even dismantling whole ideologies is ultimately fruitless until they accompany an understanding and appreciation of the people's need for representation and dignified living. Till then you'll be stuck pushing ever larger rocks up the hill till one slips and crushes you.

IsraelPalestine,The average displacement in the Nakba was 55 km (34 miles),"During the war of 1947-1949, about 720,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from localities in Israel. Today these displaced Palestinians and their descendants are about 6 million people, living in the Palestinian territories and surrounding countries. They call this displacement the Nakba, meaning catastrophe, and strongly decry it as a grave injustice that must be rectified. It's the central theme in the Palestinian narrative of the conflict.

It's hard not to sympathize with this narrative, but most people don't realize how small this area is, and how far people were actually displaced. Below is a table showing the number of Palestinians displaced by district of origin and destination: ([source](https://books.openedition.org/ifpo/5014))

Based on these numbers, the average displacement in the Nakba was about **55 km (34 miles)**. This is equivalent to the distance between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, which takes less than an hour to travel by car or train. As a comparison, the average distance traveled by refugees in other conflicts in the world is about 1600 km (1000 miles). ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9299710))

The Palestinian displacement is way too small to be called a catastrophe. It actually seems to be the shortest displacement among cases of refugees in the world.

IsraelPalestine,Two State Solution Rejection - 1947 to 2020,"Legitamate recognized information from the United Nations. No hatred, just sharing what has been recorded. 

The **U.N. and international community have repeatedly proposed two-state solutions**, yet **Palestinian leadership has consistently rejected them**, often responding with violence, maximalist demands, or political refusal. In contrast, **Israel has either accepted these proposals or engaged in serious negotiations**, even when it involved difficult compromises or security risks.

**1947 – UN Partition Plan:** The U.N. offered to divide British Mandate Palestine into a Jewish and Arab state, with Jerusalem as an international city. **Jews accepted the plan**, despite receiving less contiguous land and Jerusalem not being under their control. **Arab leaders and Palestinians rejected it outright** and launched a war against the newly declared State of Israel. Their refusal wasn’t about borders—it was about rejecting Jewish sovereignty entirely.

**1967 – Post-Six-Day War (Land for Peace):** Israel captured territory (West Bank, Gaza, Sinai, Golan) after being attacked by neighboring Arab states. Israel signaled willingness to exchange land for peace, but the **Arab League’s Khartoum Resolution declared the “Three No’s”: no peace, no recognition, no negotiations**—a blanket rejection of coexistence with Israel.

**2000 – Camp David Accords:** Israeli PM Ehud Barak, with U.S. President Bill Clinton, offered **Gaza, over 90% of the West Bank, and East Jerusalem** as the Palestinian capital. **Yasser Arafat rejected the deal without a counteroffer**, then incited the Second Intifada—years of terror attacks targeting Israeli civilians.

**2008 – Olmert Proposal:** Israeli PM Ehud Olmert offered **even more territory, land swaps, joint administration of Jerusalem, and refugee resettlement options**. Abbas walked away, admitted later he “didn’t feel he could sign,” and **never replied with a counteroffer**. The window closed permanently.

**2020 – Trump Peace Plan:** This offered a **demilitarized Palestinian state, $50 billion in investment**, and a permanent capital in parts of East Jerusalem. **The Palestinian Authority rejected it immediately**, refusing even to negotiate or attend the unveiling.

# Additional context:

* **Palestinian rejectionism is rooted in leadership priorities**—maintaining grievance politics, rejecting Jewish self-determination, and internal divisions between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.
* **Hamas, which controls Gaza, openly rejects any two-state solution**, calling for Israel’s destruction. Its charter and actions remain unchanged since its founding.
* **Israel, though far from perfect, is a democratic state that operates under international law**, with a history of making concessions for peace (e.g., withdrawing from Gaza in 2005).
* **The international community, including the U.N., EU, and the U.S., has continued to support a two-state solution**—yet there can be no resolution if one side persistently walks away or incites violence.

In every major opportunity, **Israel said yes—or at least tried**. The **Palestinian leadership said no**, often not because of specific terms, but because they still refuse to accept a Jewish state at all. **Peace requires two willing parties**, and history shows clearly which side has repeatedly walked away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lbrufw/two_state_solution_rejection_1947_to_2020/,2025-06-15 06:35:04,refugee,27
IsraelPalestine,"On Israel supporting the Gazan Bedouins with all they need to defeat Hamas from the inside, and epic culture change to bring an end to the war","The (not Jews) Druze ""Palestinians"" of the Golan Heights of northern Israel were on October 7'th attacked by Gazans/Hamas then later Syrian based Hezbollah Jihadists terrorized them, for example bombing of a playground full of children.

[Druze community mourns loss of 12 children after deadly strike in Golan Heights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlCae2z9DXo)

On account of the Israeli government coming through for them Druze now make up a large portion of the IDF and are thankful to have been offered Israeli citizenship. At the start of the war I had to cheer them on from the [r/Druze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Druze/) sub. They are now proud Israelis. Being through war together with the rest of the population of Israel has formed strong bonds that has been uniting all of Israel like never before.

There is now no news at all about the Palestinians/Druze of the Golan Heights making demands of their government such as proving itself by supplying modern progressive conveniences like running water and connection to the power grid. Regressive warmongers who do not even live there, no longer have the Golan Heights conflicts to exaggerate and exploit.

More recently it came to light that Israel similarly allied with the Bedouins in southern Gaza.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM6ErfdfnNc&t=224s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM6ErfdfnNc&t=224s)

Jidaists like Hamas can sucker some of the people, some of the time. But as in [The Who - Won't Get Fooled Again ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtHshBWFRyg)the people they attack won't get fooled again, by the banners they all flown in the last war.

With all considered the Bedouins might be the men who spurred us on, were we metaphorically from Reddit take a bow for the new revolution that from inside Gaza picks up their guitars to play like (before Islamic Jihad banned free musical expression) yesterday, to in turn sweep the philosophy of Hamas into the dustbin of history! And the morals that they worship, will be gone.

Israel offering help to the Bedouins of Gaza, like they did for Druze and others elsewhere, brings them into the Israel-wide Bedouin forces against all forms of Islamic Jihad across the land. With that understood, it's being fair and equal to all, not an enemy of my enemy is my friend situation.

According to [Wikipedia 1,500 now serve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Reconnaissance_Battalion) in the Bedouine Battalion and a [newer source says 1,655](https://greenolivetours.com/on-the-bedouin-serving-in-the-israeli-army/) and is likely greater by now:

I sense that we are in the middle of a reoccuring epic historical culture change event that was ironically explained/foretold by Rock & Roll, and can add a Blue Angels [Van Halen - Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAaZhsBvWkk) then just go with the flow from there. Smile and grin at the change all around, for places like r/ProgressivesForIsrael where virtue signaling by pointing fingers against Israel like Greta's flotilla and countless others did would make us oxymorons.

Having to be For-Israel and Progressive at the same time was a challenge that helps show where progressivism goes after Israel and progressive Gazans together end the war. Current events happening in the battle zone are extremely good news, for accomplishing that mission. What people on the outside protest for or against then has no control over the future of Gaza, the Bedouins who actually live there now do. Only thing Israel can do is hope they are proud to become part the IDF Bedouin Battalion, which is supported by Israel but they are joining with other Bedouins in the region who had it with the Jihadism.

Although it might now be easier just to go the same as the Golan Heights by accepting Israeli citizenship, I have a long July 4'th post from last year concerning a revolution in Gaza towards optional statehood at this link that tips my hat to a new constitution modeled after Israel's:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedStatesPalestine/comments/1duickw/gazans\_in\_alliance\_with\_the\_idf\_against\_hamas\_can/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedStatesPalestine/comments/1duickw/gazans_in_alliance_with_the_idf_against_hamas_can/)

At this point in time talking about what Israel does or did, totally misses what is going on in Gaza that most matters. The IDF has restored enough order to be able to provide security to people like Bedouins who deserve to become the new leaders, and eventually be able to focus on government chores instead of protecting themselves all the time. Without that the war drags on and more get hurt while people argue over the wrong things!

Besides evacuation the choices for Gazans right now is (2 state solution) declare statehood, or a path to what the Golan Heights now enjoys, by having citizenship voting rights and political power directly over the rest of the state of Israel. Both choices provide an honorable Hamas-free claim to Gaza by staying, instead of have nothing and their status as refugees makes it easy for realtors to kick them all out to get rich off the land. Others through the UN can grift off the suffering created elsewhere.

IsraelPalestine,"Escaping a warzone vs. ""Ethnic cleansing""","Hello, ill preface this by saying I'm uneducated in this matter and barely have a HS diploma (in the USA.)  I'm approaching this from the position of wanting this suffering to end, but I'm not educated in global politics. So when i tell you my point of view please understand this is genuinely what it looks like to me and probably a lot of other people. In the interest of provoking real solutions and diologue, even amongst people who rarely agree about anything, I'm making this post and I hope others can participate with the same goal in mind of alleviating suffering.


I keep hearing the argument that any plan involving voluntary mass migration from Gaza in the face of the apocolyptic destruction leveled at her amounts to ""ethnic cleansing""*, due to the coersive (at best) context. 

I can't help but think that if I was an individual in Gaza I would certainly want to leave. And from my point of view it seems hypocritical that they are being kept there by people who obstensibly are their allies. It comes across as people caring more about a Palestinian state than the Gazan people. I can understand and respect individual Gazans who choose to stay OR leave but i believe that should be a choice they get to make for themselves, is it not? It's crazy that they're trapped in a warzone,  or even a genocide (and I'm not trying to get into an endless debate about which) and the academics, politicians, and even activists are doing nothing about it, and are actively shooting down any plan that gives them a way to escape this. 

Im not naive enough to think the governments in the USA or Israel would offer such a plan out of sheer kindness, and I know there are security concerns involved for any country that would accept refugees.  I don't wish the fate of a refugee on anyone,  but the fate of someone trapped in Gaza right now against their will sounds much worse.


Is there a realistic solution here? Is there any historical precedent for this? Is there a pathway for refugees that can be created that the UN and Free Palestine movement would actually agree to? If so, what, and if not,  why? 

*please note I put the phrase ""ethnic cleansing"" in quotes because,  while I understand this is the academic term people use to describe historical events,  to me it sounds like it suggests that a place can be ""cleansed"" of an ethnicity, and it just sounds like a racist term to use.  I guess the intention is to describe the mentality of those who commit these atrocities, but I still don't like the phrase and didnt want to use it. I didn't put this phrase in quotes in an attempt to be snarky or sarcastic, or to deny the seriousness of the problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1l8geae/escaping_a_warzone_vs_ethnic_cleansing/,2025-06-11 03:36:10,refugee,9
IsraelPalestine,Why didn't Israel allow the Freedom Flotilla go to Gaza?,"I've been Pro-Isreal for quite some time, but my understanding has become extremely challenged... Logic doesn't seem to be at play and I'm confused. 

It started with wondering why journalists aren't allowed into Gaza. If a journalist wants to commit suicide, than let them. 

Yes, those that aren't killed will likely be Muslim Pro-Palestinian, and spin their narrative to include massive propaganda. But, at least Israel can't be accused of hiding anything. 

Then I thought, well Egypt isn't letting journalists in either. This isn't 'only' Israel refusing media coverage. There has to be a reason. I've read it's because Egypt doesn't want to cause friction with Israel. 

But honestly, is that all? Or, is there more?

For instance, I've also read that Egypt and other Muslim countries refuse to accept refugees. Surely, if the Palestinians were peaceful and helpful, that wouldn't be the case?

There does seen to be a historical foundation laid, regarding how detrimental it's been for middle eastern Muslim countries to accept Palestinian refugees in the past.  So, is this why?

Regarding Israel though, I've read about Israel occupying areas that, by international law, doesn't being to them. They are even approving 20'ish villages in West Bank. 

Also, this naval blockade has been in place for ages ... Only to deter arms from reaching Gaza? What about allowing Gazans to leave by boat. Is that allowed? 

If Palestinians are so terrible, why didn't they let the 'Aide Boat' with Greta Thunberg through, to showcase how terrible? (I use quotations around Aide Boat because, in my opinion the boat was never meant to give aide, but to draw attention to the situation and/or the individuals on the boat.)

I almost understand why they don't allow journalists in, if I accept the argument that some journalists, such as Al Jazeera, may betray IDF movements. But the boat? Who would they have betrayed troop movements to?

This whole situation, for me isn't making sense. Maybe, it makes perfect sense, or maybe none at all. 

I would value thoughts and insight. 

P.S. I'm not an Anti-Semite or baby killer. 

Also, I know Israel hasn't allowed  boats to go to Gaza for nearly twenty years so, they're may be an argument made that they are following procedure.

IsraelPalestine,Let’s Talk About Arab Countries’ Oppression of Palestinians — and Why the “Right of Return” Is More Complicated Than It Looks,"Hey everyone,

I think it’s important to talk about an often-overlooked part of the Palestinian refugee issue: the treatment of Palestinians in neighboring Arab countries. While these countries often claim solidarity with Palestinians, their actions on the ground have sometimes been shockingly discriminatory — and that’s worth discussing, especially when we talk about solutions like the “right of return.”

Roughly **450,000** Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon. They’re confined to overcrowded camps and face legal barriers to work in over **20 high-level professions**. They can’t own property, and they’re excluded from the country’s social security system. In 2005, reforms began easing some restrictions, but most refugees still live in poverty with limited rights. Some observers have called it a form of apartheid.

Before the Gulf War, there were about **357,000** Palestinians in Kuwait. After the PLO supported Iraq’s 1990 invasion, Kuwait expelled **287,000** Palestinians in 1991 — one of the largest mass expulsions in modern history. Many families lost everything overnight.

Jordan hosts **over 2 million** Palestinian refugees — the largest number in the region. While many were granted citizenship after 1948, around **600,000** remain without citizenship today, limiting their rights and opportunities. Jordan’s experience with Palestinian political movements (e.g. Black September in 1970) has made the government cautious about fully integrating all refugees.

Palestinians in Syria faced relatively better conditions pre-civil war, but since 2011 many have been displaced or killed. In Iraq, post-2003 instability saw Palestinians targeted by militias, leading to thousands fleeing once again.

Many advocate for the “right of return” based on UNGA Resolution 194. But there are serious challenges to this:

* **Demographics**: Bringing back millions of Palestinians and their descendants could fundamentally change the demographics of Israel, which many see as undermining its identity as a Jewish state.
* **Legal Uncertainty**: While the resolution is often cited, international law doesn’t universally recognize a right of return for refugees — especially their descendants — in the way some interpret it. Legal scholars debate its enforceability.
* **Historical Precedent**: Jewish refugees from Arab countries weren’t given a right of return, but were resettled with compensation. Some argue that compensation or resettlement could be a more realistic path.

The hardships faced by Palestinian refugees are real — but they’re not just caused by Israel. Arab states have played a significant role in perpetuating refugee suffering through systemic discrimination and denial of rights. Meanwhile, the right of return is an emotional and symbolic demand, but it comes with immense demographic, legal, and political complexities that can’t be ignored.

If we want real solutions, we need to look at all the factors — not just the convenient narratives.

Would love to hear your thoughts — and let’s keep this discussion respectful and factual.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1l0nybf/lets_talk_about_arab_countries_oppression_of/,2025-06-01 14:37:58,refugee,32
IsraelPalestine,"How the Israeli settlements grew in what supposed to be Palestinian lands, from the end of the second Intifada to the present day?","In 2005 there was ~440,000 settlers in both the West Bank & East Jerusalem, the number raised to ~520,000 in the 2010 with the return of Netanyahu to power. In 2015 it was ~600,000 and in 2020 it was ~680,000 settlers. Now as of 2025 it’s estimated to be ~730,000 – 750,000 settlers in both the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Note: Precise numbers vary slightly depending on source (Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, Peace Now, UN, B’Tselem).

Now that’s effectively a loss of 40-60% of Palestinian territory in a span of 20 years. The question is what’s the legal status of these settlements? The official definition for these settlements are : Communities established by Israelis in occupied Palestinian territory, primarily in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (captured by Israel in 1967). Most of the world considers these settlements illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention (prohibiting the transfer of a population into occupied territory). Israel disputes this. The other type is the outposts, unauthorized but often later legalized especially under Netanyahu, were built alongside official settlements. As of 2025 there’s 150 official settlements and over 100 unauthorized outposts exist.

Although most countries and organisations have described these settlements as illegal, de facto annexation, and apartheid the Trump administration broke with U.S. policy, declaring that settlements were not necessarily illegal in 2017, emboldening Israeli leaders.

How does that affect the Palestinians? 

Estimated: 15,000–25,000 Palestinians displaced from their homes directly due to settlement-related policies (2005–2025) This includes:

1. Home Demolitions for Settlement Expansion :

	•	In Area C (over 60% of the West Bank), Israeli authorities frequently demolish Palestinian homes under the claim of “unpermitted construction.”
	•	Permits are nearly impossible to obtain: Between 2016 and 2020, only 4% of Palestinian permit requests were approved.
	•	Much of this is tied to settlement expansion plans or to clear areas for new outposts, roads, or buffer zones.
	•	Over 9,000 structures demolished in Area C and East Jerusalem from 2006–2024. At least half of those were in or near areas slated for settlement expansion.

Estimated displacement: 8,000–12,000 people due directly to demolitions tied to settlement growth.

2. Land Confiscation and Forced Relocation :

	•	Israel uses a mix of military orders, state land declarations, and zoning changes to seize land for settlements.
	•	Entire Palestinian communities (e.g., Bedouin villages like Khirbet Tana, Ein al-Hilweh, and Khan al-Ahmar) have been forcibly evicted or repeatedly displaced due to being near expanding settlements.
	•	While not always recorded as formal demolitions, these communities are effectively erased or coerced to relocate.

Estimated affected: 3,000–5,000 people, often displaced more than once.

3. Settler Violence and Harassment :

	•	In recent years, there has been a marked rise in settler violence, often with military escort or protection.
	•	Entire Palestinian villages have been abandoned or depopulated due to repeated harassment, home attacks, and destruction of property (e.g., Wadi al-Siq, al-Mufaqara, and parts of Masafer Yatta).
	•	UN OCHA has documented hundreds of such incidents each year, with growing intensity since 2022.

Estimated displaced: 3,000–6,000 Palestinians in recent years.

The most recent and famous accident occurred in may 2021 in Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood where many Palestinians took the streets to protest against the Israeli settlement policy against the families living in the neighbourhood. Notice that an estimated 15,000-25,000 Palestinians lost their lands because of this colonisation. That number stands out of 70,000 Palestinians in total who lost their lands for various reasons from 2005-2025.

The main reason the second Intifada happened in 2000 was because of expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Freedom of movement was still limited, Final status issues (Jerusalem, refugees, borders) remained unresolved, and Ariel’s Sharon’s visit to Al-Aqsa mosque. The second Intifada gave rise to Hamas by the way, and now 25 years later the Israeli still enforce the same policies against the Palestinians. you don’t have to play the devil’s advocate for Hamas, but you can’t advocate for the two-state solution while still not doing anything about Israel practically killing that option! 

P.S : Netanyahu is already drawing plans to build settlements in Gaza after the war, in plain sight of the entire world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1l02omb/how_the_israeli_settlements_grew_in_what_supposed/,2025-05-31 19:32:02,refugee,7
IsraelPalestine,"Those who say the occupation is the problem, answer me why did no one side with Israel's survival wars against the Arab countries pre-1967?","It should be mentioned before my comment that I'm not against the 2-state-solution. I may not think this is the right time, and several things must happen before a Palestinian state is established, but I support the idea. Now that we got that out of the way...

Israel is afraid that if they give up on the West Bank and let a Palestinian state exist right next to it, it'll still not have international legitimacy to defend itself against hostile forces, considering no one has sided with Israel against genocidal attempts towards it before any occupation. In fact, giving up land will let said hostile forces empower themselves even more and launch deadlier assaults than ever before, making Israel more fragile. Sure, the IDF is a powerful army. But powerful doesn't mean invincible. In a matter of years, the IDF might not be enough to defeat a planned assault of all the hostile forces combined (Hamas+Hezbollah+Hoothis). And even if the IDF will still be able to pull through, Hamas and the others might go on a strategic population sacrificial move in an attempt to put blame on Israel for genocide and cause an international pressure on Israel to retreat, with the hostile forces waiting for next time to attack. This'll essentially make the cycle of violence permanent.

Israel has already proven in the past that it's more than willing to give up on land for peace. Those who say that the Gaza evacuation in 2005 was a one-sided move and it's Israel's fault for not negotiating any terms are hypocritical because they also want Israel to withdraw from the West Bank without any terms. Even if they do want a negotiated withdrawal, they know that the stronger the pressure is on Israel - the more stubborn the PA will be. The PA will raise their demands to unacceptable levels, and yet Israel will be forced to accept them. Abbas's terms are already unacceptable, as he demands a full right-to-return for all the Nakba refugees, knowing very well the states that keep them will banish them to Israel for Israel to have an Arab majority, which will make it de-facto Palestine 2. In no time, a 1-state-solution will then happen, putting Jews and supporters in the territory at a huge risk.

For a 2-state-solution to truly work, Abbas needs to give up on the right-to-return for the Nakba refugees and compromise on financial compensations. In other words, the 2008 Olmert offer (more or less) must be accepted.

But I assume the counter-argument most will say is: ""This isn't an excuse. You can't answer a theoretical fear with an active one. Do as we say and if it turns out to be bad for you... TRUST US to help you"". The ""trust me bro"" argument won't be accepted even in a million years because the world hasn't proven itself trustworthy pre-1967. No one will bet on their lives. This ain't poker. If the world had taken better steps to showcase it really will ensure Israel's security in case the 2-state-solution will backfire, Israel would've done what you want. And yet, you betray Israel and claim Israel has no choice but to trust you.

If the world had sided with Israel's wars against hostile forces before the occupation, which many claim to be the only real obstacle towards peace, Israel would've had nothing to fear. So I'll ask you yet again: ""Why did no one side with Israel's survival wars against the Arab countries pre-1967""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1kz795e/those_who_say_the_occupation_is_the_problem/,2025-05-30 17:33:38,refugee,35
IsraelPalestine,Plalestine,"I am Palestine. I never miss a chance to miss a chance.

In 1947, the United Nations offered me a state—more than 50% of the land, international recognition, and a future. I said no. I chose war instead. Five Arab armies invaded the newborn state of Israel, aiming to strangle it in its cradle. I lost. Hundreds of thousands of my people became refugees—not because Israel expelled all of them, but because Arab leaders told them to flee, promising victory within days.

I am Palestine. I have never chosen coexistence. Only resistance.

In 1967, I joined forces with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria again. Another war. Another loss. East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza—all fell under Israeli control not because they were taken from me, but because they were taken from Jordan and Egypt, who occupied them for 19 years—and never gave me a state.

I am Palestine. I could have had peace. Many times. But I always said no.

In 2000, at Camp David, Israel offered me nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as my capital. I walked away. I chose the Second Intifada instead. My people strapped explosives to their bodies and boarded buses, walked into cafes, malls, Passover seders. I called them martyrs. The world called them terrorists.

I am Palestine. I glorify death. I raise children to hate.

My textbooks teach that Israel doesn’t exist. My media tells stories of heroes who stab Jews in the street. I name schools and parks after suicide bombers. I pay salaries to murderers in prison. The more Jews they kill, the more I pay.

I am Palestine. I elected Hamas.

Not once, by mistake. But knowingly. In 2006, I voted in a terror group whose charter calls for the extermination of Jews and the destruction of Israel. Since then, rockets have flown from Gaza, thousands of them, aimed at kindergartens and homes. Every ceasefire is just a pause to rearm.

I am Palestine. I speak of occupation, but never of responsibility.

I blame Israel for everything—yet I never build anything of my own. Billions in aid from the world, yet no hospitals, no infrastructure, no future. Just tunnels for terror, textbooks for hate, and leaders who grow rich while my people suffer.

I am Palestine. I demand rights I never gave to others.

Between 1948 and 1967, not once did I call for a Palestinian state in the West Bank or Gaza. Jordan ruled one, Egypt the other. I said nothing. I only wanted the whole thing—from the river to the sea. Still do.

I am Palestine. I hold the keys to homes I fled—but never to peace.

I reject compromise. I reject Israel’s right to exist. And yet, I demand return—of land, of homes, of everything. Not to live beside the Jews, but to replace them.

I am Palestine. And I cry for justice—but worship those who murder.

I build monuments to “resistance.” I dance in the streets when Jews are killed. I film my children with toy guns, teaching them that martyrdom is glory. Then I weep before cameras, asking the world why there is no peace.

I am Palestine. And until I choose life over death, truth over lies, and peace over hate—I will never be free.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ky4qjg/plalestine/,2025-05-29 09:32:41,refugee,121
IsraelPalestine,The Great Big Lie: How the West Distorted the Conflict,"My thesis here is simple: the entire narrative about the conflict is a big lie, distorted over years by the west. The conflict is not about land, a Palestinian state, or about a nakba or oppression. Instead it is and has always been about Jews having a homeland in their indigenous land, and the conflict is not about borders or settlements but about whether Israel can exist at all. 

________

Some indisputable facts: 

1) Jews are not just a religion but an ancient people who have survived thousands of years despite numerous attempts by the general world to either assimilate them or kill them off. 

Examples included: Greeks, Romans, Naz!s, Russians, Spanish Christians, and many more. 

2) The Jews hail from this land. Archeology proves this beyond a shadow of a doubt, and Jews have had continuous presence in the land (sometimes really small) for thousands of years. 

_____

Now let’s chat about some history: 

At the turn of the 19th century as antisemitism began to raise its evil head, Zionism was born. If you read Herzl, his idea was simple. 

The world hates Jews. They prefer to not associate with Jews. Let the world give the Jews a parcel of land, and allow the Jews to get out of everyone’s hair. Jews would become self governed, live far away from everyone and participate in world affairs only to the degree that the world wants to cooperate and with whom the world wants to do so. Jews who have money would help fund migration to the Jewish land, and Jews would live and let live. 

That is all this was about, and frankly I believe all most of us Jews really want. Leave us alone. Let us do our thing and stop trying to kill us, or blame us for all your misery and misfortunes. 

It was not some colonialism project of taking over the world, or trying to disrupt religions. Jews are one of the few religions where we don’t even want people to join us, and don’t participate in any missionary activities. 

To this degree, the idea initially was to have any piece of land, but if Herzl could have his way, then the home land of Israel (currently part of the Ottoman Empire and mostly run down deserted dessert) would of course be preferable since it is after all where our people come from, our home land, and our ancestors place.

Jews began purchasing land in modern day israel, often purchasing from the Ottomans or local Arab population, and began to slowly migrate back home. 

————-

With WWI and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire the world map needed to be redrawn. This isn’t a new concept… over thousands of years, as one empire or another collapsed the world powers or victors recrafted the map and borders. In this case, the predecessor of the UN (League of Nations) tasked Great Britain with the Job of administering a chunk of the land called the Mandate for Palestine. 

This included: Lebanon, Israel, Gaza, Syria, Jordan. The mandate also instructed Britain to uphold the “Balfour Declaration” which was first agreed upon by Britain in the early stages of WWI which promised Jews a state in the land (still under Ottoman control). 

Of course one could argue “who were the British to even decide this…. And who gives the League of Nations the right to decide what to do with the land…. 

But throughout history this is exactly how it always worked. Countries, kingdoms, Empires came and went, and the powerful nations decided what to do when a state failed. We are literally witnessing this right now with Syria after the Assad regime collapsed, and the world powers seem to recognize the rebel X ISIS fighters as the new government of Syria! 

Yes, Arabs existed in Palestine. So did Jews, Christians, and others. No different than Syria where you have Christians, Druze, and Muslims living there as well. 

——

Of course the local Arabs, supported by other Arab Muslim countries did not want to see a Jewish state, no matter how large or small. They rose up against both the Jews and the British, and the Brits caved and reneged on their declaration, ultimately lying to both the Jews and the Arabs, and eventually waving the white flag on all of it as they felt they couldn’t please either parties. 

To be clear, they did however create other Arab/Muslim countries from this land, including Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan) and Lebanon for mostly Christians. So the Arabs got their state (Jordan) and the Christians got (Lebanon). The sticky part became giving the Jews their piece of the land as a state. 

Finally the UN decided in 1947-1948 on the partition plan, which the Jews accepted and promptly established the State of Israel. The Arabs refused, and instead had Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudia Arabia, and Yemen (collectively the Arab league) decided to wage a war of extermination with the clear goal of destroying all of the State of Israel, and killing all the Jews. 

This was not a Palestinian war against Zionists. In fact, it is known as the First Arab-Israeli war, because at the crux was the goal of having no Jewish state at all no matter how large or small. 

The Jews by some miracle won this war against 5 massive modern militaries. Truthfully, it’s shocking seeing how most of the Jewish population were immigrants, farmers, or holocaust survivors. They had no Air Force at all, and mostly garbage WWI relics, but when the only alternative is the complete genocide of the Jewish population, something kicks in. 

———

This in a nutshell is the conflict and has always been the conflict: The right for Jews to have a State of their own in the region. Simply put: it is and has always been a conflict of existential right of existence for Jews. It has always been a war of survival… where Israel must win or it is gone. 

_____ 

The west has twisted this into a conflict about land, who was here first, settlements, oppressor vs oppressed and so on. But this has never been the case and still isn’t. Hamas wants all of israel. They have openly said so, and their actions on Oct 7 said so. Every Jew is a settler no matter where they live. 

The 1967 was was more of the same, and so was the 1973 war and all the terrorism in between. It is why the Palestinians have refused any offer no matter what for the last 70+ years. 

In fact, until 1964 the narrative was never “Palestinians vs Israel” but Arab vs Israel. This is because the local Arabs didn’t consider themselves Palestinians. The national movement of Palestine was created after Arafat visited the Soviet Union in 1964, and frankly was a brilliant move to rewrite history and build a PR machine that would change the entire story and conflict from israel fighting for survival to one where israel is suddenly the occupier and evil monster. 

The west in a way has fallen for the scam. The Nakba was retranslated from meaning “massive military defeat by the collective Arab armies” to “ethnic cleansing of some “Palestinian” nation. Ironically, this nation didn’t exist yet when “Nakba” was used until the late 60’s. Palestinians pre-israel more often referred to Jews such as the international Palestinian football team (all Jews), or much of the Palestinian media and arts. 

Nothing proves this more than the reality from 1948-1967. While the Jews did manage to survive and push back against the massive Arab armies, they did not control all the land. The West Bank + Jerusalem was controlled by Jordan, and Gaza was controlled by Egypt. Neither Jordan nor Egypt promptly created a “Palestinian state” nor did the UN or the western world call for one to be established. Heck, even the “Palestinians” didn’t rise up and ask for one. Why? If the entire conflict was always about Palestinians having a state, wouldn’t the first thing you do be to create one on the territory you already have and then maybe expand it when you attack next in 1967? 

Unless of course the entire goal wasn’t a Palestinian state to begin with… but one of destroying and killing all Jews. 

But to suit this new narrative Israel became the aggressor and the poor Palestinians switched from being just “Arabs” to some 5 million “refugees”. All the while of course being funded and supported by billions of Muslims across 50+ countries many who hold precious resources like oil. 70 years of attempted genocide by Arabs on Jews has culminated to the evil mockery of now trying to paste the label on Jews, when once again Israel experienced an invasion and is trying to fight back. 

In my view: I pity the ignorant, and to those who pretend to be educated I recognize that good old Jewish hatred is alive and well.  

To be clear: I am not arguing that Palestinians don’t deserve the right to self determination, or that they should be occupied. Back in the early days the idea of Zionism was to build a land for a people in a land without a people. Palestine didn’t have “a people” it had people. No one denies that. But the Palestinians werent a people and you won’t find any evidence of it at all as a nation.

IsraelPalestine,We need to talk,"So for context, I am a non religious Jew, Gen-X, and although I was not born is Israel I lived roughly half my life there.



For a while now, I have been having many dozens of conversations in OmeTV, and I have to say - it is not for the faint of heart.



For some reason, 99% of the people I talk there are Muslims from all around the world.



Syrian, Iranian, Turkish, Kurdish, Lebanese, Palestinians and more. Many refugees or immigrants in Europe, many in their own countries.



OmeTV is a notoriously toxic place, and people - regardless of gender, race, religion or nationality - will typically start the conversation by yelling insults, may them be personal attacks on your appearance, or anything else they can think of (the sky is the limit, you won't believe their creativity).



The App will let people know where I am talking from, so when they see I am from Israel unsurprisingly they start yelling all types of slurs, pretty much what you would expect. Also very commonly, they will chant ""free free Palestine"".



For some reason, I don't get triggered by any of it, and I tell them as much. I ask them if they want to have a conversation with me, and I also preface stating that I respect them (my interlocutor) very much, I respect Palestinians and I respect Islam, despite our big differences today.



And here is where the magic happens: with a few exceptions, all of them transform and immediately show true respect back at me!



The very same people that yelled the worst things I could imagine at me moments ago, prove themselves to be really respectful when showed respect. This is a beautiful thing on its own right, and was incredibly surprising and revealing to me.



So at this point the conversation starts. And it's not about winning the argument and not even about convincing. It's about listening and being listened to. I don't get defensive when their views feel insulting. I gently explain how my own perspectives on that particular point differ from theirs. You would be mind-blown how often they actually agree with my view. Not because I convinced them or imposed on them, it's just that they have actually never heard another narrative, and when they do it actually makes sense to them.



We see people yell past each other all the time in the social media and it often feels we are doomed. It feels our divisions are unsurpassable, and the future is grim. But my experience in OmeTV (of all places) made me truly hopeful that we can talk indeed, no matter how far we are. It requires a lot of patience, introspection, humble conviction and above all: respect.



After more than 20 years feeling unhopeful that we can ever have any peace, my hope has been re-kindled.



But we need to talk.

  
PS: it's late now, so I probably won't be able to reply to comments, but I will do my best to address as many as I can in the near future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1kxo7ur/we_need_to_talk/,2025-05-28 20:13:53,refugee,49
IsraelPalestine,There IS a Genocide in Gaza. (with undeniable facts and proof),"The word ""genocide"" gets thrown around a lot, especially when we talk about what's happening in Gaza. It's a heavy word, and rightly so, because it refers to the absolute worst crime a group can commit. But many people, including legal experts and international bodies, are saying that Israel's actions actually fit the bill. Let's dig into *why* they're saying that.

First off, what *is* genocide? It's not just ""a lot of people getting killed."" There's a specific legal definition that comes from the **1948 UN Genocide Convention**. It says genocide is committing any of these acts:

* **Killing members of a specific group.**
* **Causing serious physical or mental harm to that group.**
* **Deliberately creating conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction (in whole or in part).**
* **Imposing measures to prevent births within the group.**
* **Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.**

The *super crucial* part here is **intent**. It's not enough to just do bad things; you have to *intend* to destroy that group (whether it's a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group) ""as such."" Proving intent is tricky, but you can infer it from patterns of action, the scale of destruction, and even official statements.

So, why are so many people, including countries like South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing Israel of genocide? Let's look at the specific allegations:

# 1. Mass Killings: The Sheer Scale of Death

This is the most visible and heartbreaking part. The numbers coming out of Gaza are horrific: tens of thousands killed, with a disproportionate number being women and children.

* **Indiscriminate Bombing:** Critics argue that Israel's use of massive bombs in densely populated areas, including refugee camps and residential blocks, isn't just targeting Hamas. They say it shows a disregard for civilian life. Imagine dropping a 2,000-pound bomb in a crowded city block – the collateral damage is immense.
* **""Safe Zones"" That Aren't Safe:** Israel tells people to evacuate to ""safe zones,"" but then those zones themselves get bombed. This leaves people with nowhere to go and no real safety, leading to more deaths and displacement.
* **Entire Families Wiped Out:** We've seen countless reports of entire families being annihilated in single airstrikes. It's not just individuals dying; it's the destruction of family units, which is part of the fabric of a group.

**Sources for this point:**

* UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) regularly updates casualty figures.
* Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reports frequently detail strike impacts.

# 2. Causing Serious Bodily & Mental Harm

Beyond direct killings, the suffering is immense and widespread.

* **Mass Injuries & Disabilities:** Tens of thousands are injured, many permanently. And with the healthcare system in ruins (more on that), many of these injuries lead to preventable deaths or lifelong disability.
* **Widespread Trauma:** Imagine living under constant bombing, losing your home, your family, your sense of safety. The mental health crisis in Gaza is catastrophic, especially for children. This isn't just sadness; it's deep, pervasive psychological harm.
* **Sexual & Gender-Based Violence:** A recent UN investigation (March 2025) even pointed to increasing sexual violence and other gender-based violence against Palestinians, which directly harms the group.

**Sources for this point:**

* Reports from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and other medical NGOs.
* UN Women reports on gender-based violence.
* WHO (World Health Organization) reports on the mental health crisis.

# 3. Deliberately Inflicting Conditions for Physical Destruction

This is where the ""siege"" aspect comes in. It's about making life so impossible that the group literally can't survive.

* **Starvation as a Weapon:** Israel's near-total blockade on Gaza has severely restricted food, water, fuel, and medical supplies. Organizations like the UN and Oxfam are screaming that famine is imminent. When you intentionally cut off basic necessities, you're creating conditions designed to kill. The ICJ even ordered Israel to allow more aid in, recognizing the grave risk.
* **Destroying the Healthcare System:** Hospitals have been bombed, besieged, or rendered unusable. Healthcare workers have been killed. This isn't just collateral damage; it's the systematic dismantling of a system vital for life. If people can't get medical care for injuries or illnesses, they die.
* **Forced Displacement & No Shelter:** Millions have been forced to move multiple times, crammed into tiny, unsanitary areas with no proper shelter or hygiene. This creates perfect breeding grounds for disease and makes basic survival impossible.
* **Widespread Destruction of Infrastructure:** Homes, schools, bakeries, water systems, farms – huge swaths of Gaza are completely destroyed. This makes the area literally uninhabitable, leaving no place for people to live and rebuild their lives.

**Sources for this point:**

* UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency) reports on aid shortages and displacement.
* Oxfam and World Food Programme (WFP) reports on food insecurity.
* Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on destruction of infrastructure.

# 4. Preventing Births

This might sound strange, but it's part of the legal definition of genocide.

* **Attacks on Reproductive Healthcare:** The destruction of maternity wards, clinics, and the lack of vital supplies means pregnant women can't get proper care. This leads to higher rates of miscarriages, premature births, and maternal/infant mortality. If a group can't successfully reproduce, its future is threatened.
* **Stress & Malnutrition Impacting Pregnancy:** The extreme stress, malnutrition, and lack of basic services also directly impact fertility and successful pregnancies.

**Sources for this point:**

* UNFPA (UN Population Fund) reports on maternal health in conflict zones.
* Medical journals and reports from doctors on the ground in Gaza.

# 5. Forcibly Transferring Children

This specific charge has surfaced more recently.

* **Allegations of Child Abduction:** The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has reported instances of Palestinian children being abducted by Israeli forces and moved out of Gaza without their families or knowledge of their whereabouts. While perhaps not as widespread as other acts, it directly falls under the convention if proven.

**Sources for this point:**

* Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor.

# The ""Intent"" Factor: What Israeli Officials Are Saying

This is where things get really controversial. Proving intent is hard, but when high-ranking officials make certain statements, it becomes part of the evidence.

* **""Human Animals"" & Dehumanization:** Israel's former Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, referred to Palestinians as ""human animals."" This kind of dehumanizing language is often seen as a dangerous precursor to genocide, making it easier to justify extreme violence against a group.
* **Invoking ""Amalek"":** Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself invoked the biblical story of Amalek, where ancient Israelites were commanded to ""utterly destroy"" them, ""men and women, children and infants."" Critics argue this isn't just rhetoric; it's a clear signal of intent to eradicate.
* **Calls for ""Flattening Gaza"" and ""No Innocent Civilians"":** Other Israeli ministers and military figures have made statements suggesting there are no innocent civilians in Gaza or advocating for the complete destruction of the territory.

While Israel says these are taken out of context or refer only to Hamas, the pattern of these statements combined with the devastation on the ground is what leads many to infer genocidal intent. The International Criminal Court's recent move to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant (for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including ""starvation as a method of warfare"" and ""extermination"") further underscores the legal seriousness of these accusations.

**Sources for this point:**

* Transcripts and recordings of official statements (widely available via news media).
* South Africa's ICJ submission (publicly available).

# So, Is It Genocide?

The **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** hasn't said definitively that Israel is committing genocide. But they *did* find a **""plausible risk of genocide""** and ordered Israel to take steps to prevent it. This is a HUGE deal in international law.

Beyond the ICJ, many leading **genocide scholars**, human rights organizations like **Amnesty International**, and numerous **UN Special Rapporteurs** have concluded that Israel's actions *do* meet the legal threshold for genocide. They point to the systematic nature of the violence, the intent inferred from official statements, and the creation of uninhabitable conditions for the Palestinian people in Gaza.

Israel denies the charges, saying its actions are self-defense against Hamas. However, under international law, even in self-defense, there are limits. The accusations of genocide argue that Israel has gone far beyond those limits, targeting an entire population with genocidal intent.

This isn't just a political debate; it's a legal one with profound implications for international law and human rights.

**Allegations of Genocide Against Israel and its Leaders:**

The primary accusation of genocide against Israel comes from South Africa, which filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on December 29, 2023.

South Africa's Allegations at the ICJ: South Africa alleges that Israel's conduct in Gaza constitutes genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The suit argues that Israel's actions demonstrate a ""requisite specific intent... to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.""

The alleged genocidal acts identified in the suit include:

Mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza.

Causing serious bodily and mental harm to Palestinians.

Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, including:

Expulsion and forced displacement from their homes.

Deprivation of access to adequate food and water.

Deprivation of access to humanitarian assistance, including fuel, shelter, clothes, hygiene, sanitation, medical supplies, and medical care.

The destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza.

Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.

The ICJ, in its provisional measures orders (January 26, 2024, and March 28, 2024), did not rule on whether Israel was committing genocide, but found that there was a ""plausible risk of genocide"" and ordered Israel to take all measures within its power to prevent acts contrary to the Genocide Convention, including ensuring the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. On May 24, 2024, the ICJ also issued an order that some experts interpreted as requiring Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah, an interpretation Israel rejected.

Other Organizations and Experts Accusing Israel of Genocide/Genocidal Acts:

Amnesty International: Concluded in a December 2024 report that ""Israel has carried out acts prohibited under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza."" They cite killings, serious bodily or mental harm, and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction.

UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices: Stated in November 2024 that ""Israel's warfare in Gaza is consistent with the characteristics of genocide, with mass civilian casualties and life-threatening conditions intentionally imposed on Palestinians there."" They specifically highlighted the use of starvation as a weapon of war and the intentional destruction of vital services.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor: Notes that the Israeli army has abducted Palestinian children and transferred them out of Gaza.

Genocide Watch: Accused both Hamas and Israel of committing acts of genocide in the Gaza war, with a ""Genocide Emergency Alert"" on October 17, 2023, and a subsequent statement on October 24, 2023, where scholars asserted Hamas's actions against Israeli civilians qualify as genocide, and Israel's actions as well.

Luis Moreno Ocampo (former ICC prosecutor): Stated in December 2023 that Israel's siege of Gaza ""is a crime against humanity and a form of genocide.""

Other Charges and Criticisms Against Israel and its Members:

International Criminal Court (ICC) Charges: On November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister of Israel) and Yoav Gallant (former Minister of Defense of Israel).

The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include:

War crime of starvation as a method of warfare.

Crimes against humanity, including:

Extermination

Murder

Persecution

Other inhumane acts

These charges relate to alleged crimes committed from at least October 8, 2023, until at least May 20, 2024. The ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber I found ""reasonable grounds"" to believe they bear criminal responsibility as co-perpetrators for these acts.

Additionally, a Franco-Israeli lawyer has filed a case with the ICC, calling for the prosecution of eight individuals for the crime of incitement to genocide, including current and former high-ranking Israeli government and military officials, and a journalist. These include:

Itamar Ben-Gvir (National Security Minister)

Bezalel Smotrich (Finance Minister)

Giora Eiland (former major general in the Israeli Defence Forces)

Tzvi Yehezkeli (television journalist)

Other Criticisms and Allegations:

War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity: Beyond the ICC warrants, numerous human rights organizations and UN bodies accuse Israel of various war crimes and crimes against humanity, including indiscriminate attacks, targeting of civilians, excessive force, and disproportionate attacks.

IsraelPalestine,Netanyahu’s latest war goal risks accelerating Israel becoming a pariah state,"By James M. Dorsey

This week, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu accelerated the Jewish state’s travels towards international pariah status by declaring that the Gaza war aims to expel Gazan Palestinians from their homeland.

Mr. Netanyahu added resettlement of Gaza’s 2.1 million Palestinians to his war goals after earlier adopting as official Israeli policy a plan to move Gazans out of the Strip first put forward by US President Donald J. Trump in February.

Earlier, Mr. Netanyahu insisted that he would only end the Gaza war once the Israeli military has destroyed Hamas or if the group agrees to disarm and send its leadership and fighters into exile.

By making Mr. Trump’s plan a war goal Mr. Netanyahu has officially changed the nature of the century-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Mr. [Trump’s plan envisions Palestinians being resettled in Egypt, Jordan, and elsewhere](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/13/trumps-gaza-plan-what-it-is-why-its-controversial-and-globally-rejected) so that Gaza could be turned into a high-end real estate development.

The international community has virtually unanimously condemned his plan.  Many charge that it would amount to ethnic cleansing and violate international law.

Even so, Israel has sought to gradually implement the plan and placate Israel’s remaining supporters by [relaxing rules governing departures from Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-plan-or-not-israel-is-letting-more-palestinians-leave-gaza-2025-05-19/).

In recent months, Israel allowed some 1,000 Palestinians with foreign citizenship and their families, as well as students with foreign scholarships, to leave Gaza. They included people who Israel had barred from travel for security reasons.

Supporters of Mr. Netanyahu’s latest war goal hope the departures are the tip of the iceberg.

A recent [Palestinian opinion poll](https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/997) suggested that Israel’s 19-month-long decimation of Gaza to a pile of rubble and its blocking of the unfettered entry of humanitarian goods into the Strip has persuaded almost half of the territory’s population to consider resettlement.

Forty-three per cent of those surveyed said they were willing to leave Gaza. Forty-nine per cent suggested they would be willing to ask Israel to allow them to depart through Israeli air and seaports.

Israeli officials were likely also encouraged by mounting Gazan resentment of Hamas.

Forty-eight per cent of those surveyed supported recent anti-Hamas protests demanding that the group surrender control of the Strip, even though a majority believed external forces had instigated the demonstrations.

Nevertheless, Netanyahu’s adoption of the Trump plan as a war goal ensures that there will be no resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It will force Israel to continue to live by the sword indefinitely – a prospect already envisioned by legendary Israeli chief-of-staff and defense minister [Moshe Dayan in the 1950s](https://jamesmdorsey.substack.com/p/ceasefire-talks-are-about-more-than).

The adoption will likely fuel Israel’s further isolation, with some of its closest European allies distancing themselves, given broad international support for a two-state resolution of the conflict, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state next to Israel.

By making Mr. Trump’s plan a war goal Mr. Netanyahu has officially changed the nature of the century-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Adding resettlement or ethnic cleansing to Israel’s war goals, cements Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim beliefs that resettlement was Israel’s unofficial goal from day one.

They point to the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the 1948 and 1967 Middle East wars and Israel’s post-1967 policy of establishing settlements on occupied Palestinian lands.

“Neither the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) nor the government seems to understand the depth of [the looming international crisis](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-23/ty-article/.premium/trump-puts-the-brakes-on-bibi-in-gaza-and-leaves-israel-to-worry-about-the-hostages/00000196-f973-d6d3-ab9e-fb7b83170000),” said journalist Amos Harel.

Compounding the risk of further isolation and becoming a pariah state, Israel’s adoption of the Trump plan as a war goal guarantees that no Arab state, including Saudi Arabia, will recognise Israel and could put the country’s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, fearful that West Bank Palestinians could be next, in jeopardy.

That may be where the rub is in Mr. Trump’s attitude towards Israel’s policy change, even though Israel’s war goal is based on his plan.

Mr. Trump sees engineering Saudi and Arab recognition of Israel as a pillar of his Middle East policy.

Moreover, making the expulsion of Palestinians dressed up as “voluntary” departures a war goal casts a different light on Israel’s almost [three-month-long blocking of the flow of any humanitarian aid into Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-strikes-kill-palestinians-protecting-gaza-aid-trucks-hamas-says-2025-05-23/), including food, medicine, and fuel, and Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign to [undermine Qatari efforts to mediate a Gaza ceasefire](https://jamesmdorsey.substack.com/p/qatar-is-at-the-center-of-a-battle).

The blocking of aid may be the straw that breaks the camel’s back by widening the emerging gap between Messrs. Trump and Netanyahu and sparking the harshest criticism of Israel to date by some of its closest allies.

Mr. Netanyahu’s added war goal could sway countries like Britain, Canada, and France to [recognise Palestine as a state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html).

The three countries have for weeks said they were discussing possible recognition in response to Israel’s blocking the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza since March 2.

Israel has, in recent days, allowed a minuscule number of trucks carrying humanitarian goods into Gaza, far below the Strip's minimal needs. UN officials described the flow as ""a drop in the ocean.""

Recognition of Palestine as state is likely to be high on the agenda of a June 18 gathering convened by France and Saudi Arabia under the auspices of the United Nations to promote a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

So is [a muted French-Saudi plan](Paris%20and%20Riyadh%20are%20devising%20a%20plan%20to%20have%20the%20Hamas%20terror%20group%20disarmed,%20but%20let%20it%20retain%20political%20influence%20over%20the%20Gaza%20Strip,%20according%20to%20a%20Bloomberg%20%5breport%5d(https:/www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/france-and-saudi-arabia-aim-to-disarm-hamas-in-new-peace-push%20%22Ctrl-click%20to%20open:%20https:/www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/france-and-saudi-arabia-aim-to-disarm-hamas-in-new-peace-push%22).) intended to break the stalemate in the Gaza ceasefire talks that would require Hamas to disarm but allow it to retain political influence by functioning as a political group rather than a militia.

With the destruction of Hamas as one of his war goals, Mr. Netanyahu accused Britain, France, and Canada of being “on the wrong side of history” and [wanting “Hamas to remain in power.""](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7804k13x52o)

Mr. Netanyahu didn’t mention Saudi Arabia, but his assertion presumably also applies to the kingdom.

The French-Saudi proposal builds on Hamas’ declared willingness to walk away from governing post-war Gaza in the face of widespread popular resentment of the group and the knowledge that it would be an obstacle to reconstruction and incapable of attracting the funding and international support needed.

Hamas’ willingness was in the making long before the group attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, sparking the Gaza War.

Israel’s blockade of Gaza since the group took control of the Strip in 2007 with Egypt’s de facto support undermined Hamas's ability to legitimise its rule by effectively providing goods and services.

Writing about the blockade in place since Israel’s 2008 attack on Gaza, dubbed Operation Cast Lead, [historian Erik Skare](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/3304-road-to-october-7) noted that ""the blockade could never produce Israeli security, only immense Palestinian suffering.”

Seventeen years later, that is truer than ever.

Mr. Netanyahu’s encouragement of [Qatari funding of Hamas’s Gaza administration](https://jamesmdorsey.substack.com/p/netanyahu-and-hamas-a-symbiotic-relationship) as a way of keeping the Palestinian polity divided so that it would be incapable of negotiating a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict came to haunt the prime minister with the group’s deadly October 7 attack.

Referring to Israel’s long-standing blockade, Mr. Skare noted n a just-published book, "" Governing Gaza under a blockade and international isolation deepened (Hamas hardliners"") conviction...that there was no political or diplomatic solution.”

True to Israeli policy since the 1967 Middle East war that strengthened Palestinian hardliners rather than moderates, Mr. Netanyahu balanced funding of Hamas with policies that favoured hardliners in the group’s internal politicking.

“October 7 happened because the moderates in Hamas had few if any, victories to show after the movement won the legislative elections in 2006,” Mr. Skare asserted.

Like the West Bank-based, internationally recognised Palestine Authority, Hamas realized that government created a different reality, in which it was responsible for securing Gaza’s borders, and, with it, Israel’s borders, despite upholding the principle of armed struggle.

“The legitimacy of Hamas in Gaza no longer derived solely from its status as an armed resistance movement, but…as a service provider to the Gazan population as well,” Mr. Skare said.

Hamas’ dichotomy, exploited by Israel with its blockade, frames the group’s attitude towards disarmament.

The group has spoken about the issue from both sides of its mouth. At times the group has insisted it will not disarm.

Yet, Hamas officials have also suggested they would be willing to [put their arsenal under the supervision of a third party](https://www.bbc.com/arabic/articles/crm384w4zkko), possibly the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) or Egypt, as part of a ceasefire that ends the war and guarantees an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Lebanon could provide a precedent even though Hamas is likely to be more amenable to disarmament in a third country like Lebanon as opposed to Gaza, which it insists is part of the Palestinian homeland.

Hamas this week suggested it would [conditionally disarm in Lebanese Palestinian refugee camps](https://aawsat.com/%20لعالم-العربي/المشرق-العربي/5145780-حماس-تشترط-الحوار-مع-الفصائل-لنزع-السلاح-الفلسطيني-في-لبنان) under an agreement with the Lebanese government to remove the weapons of all Palestinian factions negotiated by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during a three-day visit to Lebanon.

Hamas reportedly insisted that disarmament would depend on granting Palestinians their civil and human rights, a reference to the lifting of restrictions on Palestinians’ rights in Lebanon, including free access to the labour market.

The push to disarm Hamas, alongside other Palestinian factions in Lebanon, also serves a broader US and Israeli effort to replicate elements of the 1982 model that forced Yasser Arafat’s PLO to evacuate Beirut and move to Tunis, 3,500 kilometres away from Israel’s borders.

Sixty-four per cent of the Gazans polled by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research opposed disarmament of Hamas, while 64 per cent were against exiling the group’s leaders despite a substantial number of Gazans’ resentment of Hamas.

Mr. Netanyahu’s elevation of Gazan resettlement to a war goal takes Israel’s US-backed multi-pronged effort to empty the Strip of its indigenous population and squash Palestinian national aspirations to a new level.

Beyond Israel’s demand that Hamas abandon Gaza, the effort involves Syria’s recent [expulsion of Hamas and other Palestinian operatives](https://www.barrons.com/news/palestinian-faction-chiefs-quit-damascus-amid-pressure-faction-sources-a2a90837) under US and Israeli pressure and pressure on Lebanon to halt the flow of funds to Hamas through Lebanon.

IsraelPalestine,I recently made this reply to a post using information I wish was common knowledge. Do you think this is accurate?,"This was all information that I've read individually, and have formatted and fact-checked.  
  
  
In short the name Palestine comes from the Philistines, an ancient people who settled along the southern coast of Canaan around the 12th century BCE, likely after the Bronze Age collapse and the Sea Peoples' invasions. The term was later adopted by the Romans in 135 CE, who renamed Judea Syria Palaestina to suppress Jewish identity in the region.

The modern Palestinian people are descended from the many groups who lived in the area over centuries — including Canaanites, Arameans, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and others — and formed a distinct Arab identity in the 20th century, especially during and after the British Mandate period.   
  
Lots of Jews ignore this, I don't know why??:

Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantines) lost the region to Muslim Arab forces during the Islamic conquests of the 7th century. The decisive moment came after the Battle of Yarmouk in 636 CE, and by 638 CE, the Muslim Rashidun Caliphate had full control of Jerusalem and the broader region.

* Under Roman/Byzantine rule, Jews faced severe persecution, including:
   * Expulsions from Jerusalem.
   * Bans on religious practices and rebuilding the Temple.
   * Widespread violence and repression after revolts.
* Under early Muslim rule, Jews were generally treated better:
   * They were granted dhimmi status — protected but second-class citizens.
   * Jews were allowed to return to Jerusalem, which had been forbidden under Byzantines.
   * They paid a special tax (jizya) but could practice their religion and manage their own communities.

So, the Muslim conquest not only ended Roman (Byzantine) control, but also marked a relatively more tolerant period for Jews compared to the centuries of Roman repression.

# “Does Palestine exist? No, Palestine simply has never existed. Not now not ever.”

False.

* The term Palestine has existed for over 2,000 years, first used by Herodotus (5th century BCE), and later formalized by the Romans in 135 CE as Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kokhba revolt to erase Jewish identity from Judea.
* The region of Palestine has been recognized in various forms under Ottoman, British, and international administrative systems (e.g., the British Mandate for Palestine from 1920–1948).
* The Palestinian people began identifying as such especially during the 20th century, following patterns of modern nationalism.
* Palestinian identity coalesced more strongly in the early 20th century as part of the anti-colonial and anti-Zionist response, not unlike many other national identities worldwide.
* Yes The Romans renamed Judea Syria Palaestina in 135 CE after the Jewish revolt, to suppress Jewish ties to the land, however, this does not negate the region’s identity evolving over time to include many groups, including Arabs.

# “Jews have stayed in this region since Roman times.”

True.

* A continuous but minority Jewish presence existed throughout history.
* But the majority of the population after Roman times became predominantly Arab, Muslim, and Christian.

# “Canaanites are mostly Jews.”

False / Oversimplified.

* Ancient Canaanites were a distinct people who predated the Israelites.
* Israelites emerged out of Canaanite society, but they were not identical.
* Modern Jews are not direct descendants of Canaanites, and neither are Palestinians.
* Palestinians may also descend from a mix of ancient peoples of the region, including Canaanites, Arameans, Greeks, Arabs, and others.

# “The two-state solution happens and Arabs go to Gaza.”

False.

* There was no two-state solution implemented at the time of Israel’s founding in 1948.
* The UN proposed a two-state plan in 1947, which Zionist leaders accepted but Arab leaders rejected (partially because it allocated 55% of the land to a Jewish state when Jews were only about 33% of the population).
* War broke out. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced, and many ended up in Gaza — not voluntarily, but as refugees.

# “Arab countries attacked Israel in the 6-Day War because of antisemitism.”

Misleading.

* The 1967 war (Six-Day War) was sparked by regional tensions, including Israeli-Arab conflict over land, Egyptian troop movements into Sinai, and the closing of the Straits of Tiran.
* While antisemitism existed, the war was primarily about territorial and national conflict, not purely religious or racial hatred.

# “The Palestinian people have been brainwashed by Hamas.”

False and dehumanizing.

* Not all Palestinians support Hamas. Many oppose both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
* Palestinians are diverse in views, and many are secular, leftist, or non-aligned.
* Hamas does have influence, especially in Gaza, but the idea of mass ""brainwashing"" is an oversimplification and undermines their humanity and agency.

# “Iran funds all anti-Israel terror groups.”

True, but an exaggeration.

* Iran does fund groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, but not every anti-Israel group.
* Many Palestinian groups (like the PFLP or Fatah in the West Bank) have different ideologies and funding sources, including from Arab states.

# “‘Free Palestine’ means ‘kill every Jew inside it.’”

False / Extremely misleading.

* The phrase “Free Palestine” generally refers to ending Israeli occupation and granting Palestinians self-determination, though interpretations vary.
* It does not inherently mean genocide, most people like myself and other protestors support a two-state solution or equal rights.

# “Israeli genocide is a lie.”

Semantic dispute

* While the term ""genocide"" is debated by legal scholars, many UN officials, legal experts, and human rights groups have raised grave concerns about Israeli military conduct in Gaza, especially post-October 7, 2023.
* Over 35,000 Palestinians have been killed, the majority being women and children, with large-scale destruction of homes, hospitals, and infrastructure.
* Whether it meets the legal definition of genocide is under investigation by the International Court of Justice, it remains true that Israel collectively punishes innocent civilians, while continuing to spread propaganda that dehumanizes Palestinians.

IsraelPalestine,Let's Assume the Worst of the Nakba Was True. Was 77+ Years of War Worth it?,"The immense suffering of both Israelis and Palestinians over the last 77+ years is undeniable. Even the most pro/anti on both sides can agree both sides have suffered and unfortunately peace seems less hopeful than ever. ​

The foundational grievance of the Palestinian narrative is the Nakba, the displacement of \~700,000 Arabs in 1948. For the purpose of this discussion, let's accept this as a profound historical injustice that has defined Palestinian identity for generations. The central political goal has often been framed as rectifying this injustice, primarily through the ""Right of Return.""

At the same time, history provides other contexts for mass displacement. The aftermath of WWII saw some 40-65 million people uprooted in Europe. While these events were deeply traumatic, the long-term response was almost universally one of resettlement and integration into new societies. The refugee crises, as political movements, eventually subsided. That is, except for the Palestinian Arabs. 

The Palestinian case is unique in its persistence across generations, institutionally maintained by UNRWA. This leads to my core question: Has the strategic choice to focus on reversing the outcome of 1948, rather than prioritizing the creation of a thriving state on available land, ultimately served the best interests of the Palestinian people, or the region as a whole?

This is not to dismiss the Israeli narrative—which includes the context of a war of annihilation being waged against it, the subsequent Mizrahi refugee crisis, and the argument that many Arabs left voluntarily or at the behest of Arab leaders. But for a moment, I want to set aside the ""who is to blame"" debate and focus on the ""what now?""

Was it worth it? Is there a point where acknowledging the irreversible nature of past events and shifting focus entirely to building the best possible future becomes the most ethical and pragmatic path forward for everyone, especially the children of the region? Let's assume the 700k Arabs in the Nakba were given the short end of the stick in life - is that worth 77+ years of war? How much time needs to go by before the Palestinian Arab side says ""ok, it's just not worth it anymore, let's build a state and commit to peace for our children's sake""

IsraelPalestine,"If a people becomes displaced, do they deserve to be stateless forever?","I've often heard people say that just because Jews were displaced from Israel 2000 years ago doesn't mean they have the right to the land anymore.

I could understand if they were talking about a people who was displaced 2000 years ago, move somewhere new, integrated into that new placed and treated with dignity there, and lived peacefully there ever since. Such a people wouldn't even think to try and return to a place they were thousands of years ago, since they've had a new home since then, and probably don't even remember what group of people they used to be part of. It would be like an American whose family came to the U.S. in the 1600s — such a person would probably have no interest in returning to, say, Germany and trying to establish sovereignty there because their ancestors were German tribespeople 2,000 years ago. Why would they? They are fully self determined Americans who are living well where they are and have for centuries.

But after getting displaced, Jews were not peacefully integrated somewhere new. Instead, they were persecuted and displaced for the next 2,000 years. They were displaced and attacked in Italy, Morocco, France, Yemen, England, Spain, Iraq, Germany, Russia, Arab countries (including by ancestors of Palestinians) and everywhere else they went. They were a wandering, stateless people, never safe anywhere, let alone equal.

When you think about it, what they are really saying is that, since Jews were displaced and forced to be stateless refugees, constantly being displaced and persecuted everywhere they went for so long, they have some sort of cosmic curse where they must be displaced and persecuted forever.

This strikes me as unfair. Why should being more persecuted and displaced more often make Jews less deserving of self determination than anyone else?

Say Gazans are displaced after this war. And say everywhere they go, people attack them and keep displacing them, so they must keep wandering the earth, constantly attacked and genocided. Say this goes on for a thousand years. Does that mean they must never try to return to Gaza? Does that mean they are also cosmically cursed and must wander the earth as stateless, persecuted people, never allowed to return home? Or does this curse specifically apply to Jews?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ktzwdd/if_a_people_becomes_displaced_do_they_deserve_to/,2025-05-24 03:22:27,refugee,7

Does displacing 2 million Gazans really achieve peace?,"Often they would say, I dont care where they (Palestinians in Gaza) end up or go to... go to Ireland, Spain, Europe, Egypt, Jordan, Canada, etc... anywhere but here.

They have this oversimplistic point of view, out of sight, out of mind. But does it, really?

They say Palestinians would be better off, leaving  Gaza — that they would have safety, they will be free from Hamas oppression, they will have more comfortable and stable lives if they were to resettle elsewhere. Gaza is a big demolition site, war torn, unliveable. It will takes decades and lots of money to rebuild Gaza. 

Wont this solution creates even more pain, more suffering and more resentment that may last for generations ? Does this even resemble anything like a long term peace solution ? What if years later from now, the problem once forgetten, resurfaced with a vengeance to haunt Israel again ? 

Wouldnt 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank think, they could be next to be displaced after Gaza ?

They are not going to stop advocating for Palestine even from overseas. What if these new waves of Palestinian refugees were able climb up the social ladder to positions of power and influence, what then ? a future UK Prime Minister with Palestinian origins. Wouldnt that be a future headache for Israel ?

IsraelPalestine,White Paper of 1939,"Today (23rd of May) marks the anniversary of the White Paper of 1939 (39WP) It was an extremely important document in the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict so I thought it would be worthwhile to discuss it and its impact in this thread. 

If you don’t know about the 39WP then you really need to learn more about the history of the region. Here is a brief overview:

- In the 1930s, large numbers of Jewish refugees fled Europe for Palestine. This angered the Palestinian Arabs and led to the Arab revolt of 1936-39. At first this was primarily and economic boycott but it become more violent. The Palestinians attacked both the British and Jews and the British attempted to quell the uprising, often with brutal force.

- To help end the revolt, the British agreed to a commission that would hear and consider the Arabs concerns and objections to Zionism. The Palestinians, led by Hajj Amin al-Husseini originally boycotted that commission but eventually took part.

- The end result was the 39WP. The most significant aspect of the paper was the Jewish immigration would be cut to 75,000 over the following five years (compared with the 225,000-300,000 who had come during the 1930s) after which any further immigration would depend on Arab consent (which of course would not be granted). Jews were also banned from buying Arab land.

- Incredibly, the Palestinians initially rejected it, even though it was a huge, potentially fatal, blow to Zionist efforts. That’s a real head-scratcher.

In my opinion:

- The 39WP was a great moral failure and probably the worst thing the British did during the mandate period. 

- The British reneged on the promise they made in the Balfour Declaration and abrogated their obligations under the League of Nations (a view shared by the League of Nations).

- Furthermore, they rewarded Palestinian terrorism against the British and the Yishuv. This taught both Palestinians and Zionists that violence is an effective way of getting what you want and therefore led to more violence.

- This appeasement of the Palestinians by the Chamberlain government was perhaps strategically understandable given war was just around the corner and the Arabs (with all their oil and their control of most of the Middle East) were far more powerful than the Jews. However this backfired and the Palestinians supported the Nazis (sorry auto-mod) anyway.

- The 39WP united the yishuv against the British. While they were split regarding what to do about it, everyone agreed that the British were now the enemy. If it was ever possible to describe the yishuv as a British colonial project, the argument becomes ludicrous after 1939.

- The most abhorrent aspect of the 39WP was of course the restriction on Jewish immigration at a time when Jews in Germany were living under extreme levels of oppression, the window where Germany was allowing Jews to leave was closing and the rest of the world was turning its backs on those Jews (in the Evian conference). The decision condemned hundreds of thousands of Jews to death.

- In that context illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine in the 1940s (Aaliyah Bet) was completely morally justified. Those who helped smuggle Jews out of Europe and into Palestine were heroes. I also believe some of the attacks against the British by the Irgun were also justified, though I condemn the terrorism of the Lehi/Stern Gang.

- That the British continued to apply the policy after the war when the full horrors of the holocaust were known and huge numbers of Jews languished in displaced persons camps unable to return safely to their former homes or find a country that would take them is completely unconscionable.

What are your opinions on the White Paper? Where do you disagree with mine? What lasting impact did it have?

Edit: I just thought of another thing - by limiting Jewish migration, the British also greatly increased the chances of the Jews in Palestine being slaughtered when they left. If not for Jews brought in from Europe after 1939, the yishuv would probably have lost the war and the result would have made October 7th look small. Some people here like to talk about genocidal language - they should read what the Arabs were saying they would do when they defeated the newly-announced Jewish state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1kt11xw/white_paper_of_1939/,2025-05-22 22:28:25,refugee,22
IsraelPalestine,Question about Palestinian claims and Jordan,"I have strong views, but I’m also genuinely trying to understand how others view this conflict especially those who support the Palestinian cause.

Here’s something I keep coming back to:

Before 1948, the entire area that includes today’s Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, and Jordan was part of the British Mandate for Palestine, established after WWI when the Ottoman Empire collapsed. In 1921, the British took about 77% of that land east of the Jordan River and created Transjordan (now Jordan), giving control to the Hashemite monarchy. That land was originally intended to be part of a Jewish and/or Arab homeland under the mandate.

Today, Jordan has a Palestinian majority (estimated 60–70%). Many of them are descendants of refugees from 1948 and 1967. But here's what confuses me is that there’s no serious Palestinian national movement focused on Jordan. There’s no international push to create a Palestinian state there. And there’s very little outcry over how Palestinians are treated inside Jordan. To be specific, Palestinians in Jordan cannot hold key military or government positions, often face discrimination in higher education and civil service, can lose Jordanian citizenship arbitrarily (especially if they have West Bank ties), and are politically marginalized... all real power rests with the Hashemite monarchy

Now contrast that with Arabs in Israel, they have full citizenship, they vote in national elections and have Arab parties in the Knesset, they serve as judges, doctors, professors, and even in the IDF or police (if they choose), they have access to education, healthcare, and legal protections under the law etc.

So my question is this:

If Palestinians are the indigenous people of all of “historic Palestine,” why is there no comparable claim to Jordan... a country made from the same British Mandate, with a Palestinian majority and clear discrimination? Why is Israel the only target of this struggle for justice and land?

If the issue is really about indigeneity, sovereignty, and justice for Palestinians, shouldn’t Jordan with its origins, demographics, and policies be part of the discussion and the rage??",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ks88lc/question_about_palestinian_claims_and_jordan/,2025-05-21 22:29:02,refugee,31
IsraelPalestine,Where Is the Outrage Over the Displacement of Germans Out of Sudetenland?,"Some followers of the Israel / Palestine historical conflict may not be aware than in history there have been hundreds if not thousands of times a group of people have been displaced. 

I would like to try attention to one example that happened at a similar time and magnitude as the Arab / Israeli 1947-1949 war.

In the late 1930s Germany occupied the Sudetenland which was a German majority area (and historically ethnically German) of the country of Czechoslovakia (which itself was only about 20 years old). After WW2, the Allies agreed that all Germans should be displaced out of Sudetenland. 

2.5 - 3 million Germans were displaced, with the rationale of potential security concerns as most were Nazi supporters. 

Expulsions were seen as part of post-war retribution and efforts to create ethnically homogeneous nation-states in Central Europe. Widespread human rights abuses occurred, including massacres, forced labor, and property confiscation. Many historians see it as a case of ethnic cleansing, though justified at the time as a way to prevent future conflict.

What happened? Displaced Germans accepted integration into a separate state (Germany).

While there have been some complaints over the years, (and asking for compensations), I have not seen massive attacks from Sudeten Germans on the premise that they want to return to their ancestral homeland - even though they are probably living further away from it than Palestinian refugees are from their grandparents homes.

If these Germans began waging attacks to bring this land back to Sudeten Germans, would it be seen favorably among those that think Palestinians deserve to fight to return to Israeli land? 

Or, do you think Sudetens should just accept what happened and move on?

  
The fact is there are many cases like this, and no one cares or thinks it's reasonable to fight to undo past perceive injustices 75 years later. Except, suspiciously, for this one place in the Middle East. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ks2kew/where_is_the_outrage_over_the_displacement_of/,2025-05-21 18:42:50,refugee,33
IsraelPalestine,"They Send Missiles to Israel, and Shrouds to Gaza This Is the Reality I Live","In this upside down world, where your humanity is measured by your passport, your skin color, or your proximity to the West, the death of Palestinians doesn’t seem to count as a tragedy. It’s just a number in a news ticker, or  collateral damage in reports about supporting allies.

Gaza today is dying of hunger. Literally dying.

People are searching for a single tomato. Mothers are boiling weeds and leaves to feed their children. Children are dying from dehydration and malnutrition before the eyes of a world that watches and does nothing.

So what does the civilized world do?

It sends tens of thousands of missiles and bombs to Israel, backing it militarily, politically, and financially. It practically endorses the destruction of homes with people still inside. And at the same time, it dares to speak of  humanitarian aid. Announcements are made proudly, even that 9 aid trucks have entered Gaza!

Nine trucks… for over a million people?

But the bitter and horrifying irony is that those trucks weren’t filled with food, or water, or medicine. They were filled with *shrouds*.

Yes, shrouds the white cloth used to wrap the dead.

As if the message couldn’t be clearer: we won’t give you life… but we’ll at least cover your corpse with dignity.

Have you ever witnessed hypocrisy so naked?

The world isn’t sending sustenance it’s sending silence. Not water, but political cover. Not hope, but humiliation, all wrapped in terms like diplomacy and Israel’s right to defend itself.

I’m not sad for myself. If I’m martyred, let my shroud be from one of those trucks. But I grieve for a world that has lost its final fragment of conscience.

This is not a conflict. This is extermination. And those shrouds are not symbolic they are a global signature of complicity.

And the most painful part? Large parts of the world don’t care. Or justify it. Or stay silent.

Ask yourself: if your own children were starving to death… would you accept a shroud as “aid”?

*And me? There’s one more thing that weighs heavily on my heart:*

Families in the two refugee camps near me used to rely on me. Whenever I could, I helped whether it was food, a little money, or simply standing with them.

But today, I am powerless.

Everything I had has been drained. I’m left with nothing but my phone and the clothes on my back. I can no longer afford medicine for my injured father, or for my nephew suffering from rickets. And food? That’s become a daily battle for survival, for dignity, for life itself.

I didn’t write this for sympathy. I wrote it to say: death in Gaza doesn’t only come from bombs it comes from hunger, betrayal, and global silence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1kr4mqx/they_send_missiles_to_israel_and_shrouds_to_gaza/,2025-05-20 15:17:15,refugee,6
IsraelPalestine,The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka. It is worse,"


(To my knowledge, none of the below-stated facts are controversial. But I will be happy to be educated).



A few points of comparison:



**1.Absolute numbers:**

Roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from Israel during the 1948 war.

Roughly 1,000,000 Jews fled or were expelled from the Arab world plus Iran and Turkey in the decades that followed.

Additionally, between 30,000 to 90,000 Palestinian refugees managed to return to Israel before it could enforce effective border control. To my knowledge, few or no Jews ever returned to Arab/Muslim countries.

**2. Relative numbers:**

The Palestinian population in Israel was reduced by around 80% because of the Palestinian Nakba.

The Jewish population in most Arab/Muslim countries was reduced by 99% or even 100%.

This is significant because there still exists a vibrant (if oppressed) Palestinian society inside Israel, while the Jewish communities throughout the Arab world (some of them ancient) were completely and permanently obliterated, something not even the Holocaust could do. There are more Jews today living in Poland than in the entire Arab world.



**3. Causes:**

There's no doubt that the Zionists took advantage of the chaos of the 1948 war to reduce the Palestinian population as much as possible. There's also no doubt that there would have been hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees even if the Zionists *were actively trying* to make them stay. Every war in the history of the planet has caused massive refugee crises, and the blame for them usually falls on whoever started the war. It should be noted that there were also tens of thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing the war in the opposite direction, from Gaza and Hebron and Jerusalem into Israel. Again, not a single Jew was allowed to remain in the Arab-controlled territories of Palestine after the war.



The Jewish exodus from Arab countries took place in peacetime. Many Jews immigrated willingly for ideological reasons, but there were also numerous pogroms, expulsions, and various state policies to make life impossible for Jews. All of this could have been easily avoided, if the Arab governments weren't pursuing an active policy of ethnic cleansing. To this day, Jewish presence is either barely tolerated in Arab society, or tolerated not at all. The most extreme Israeli Arab-hater doesn't hold a candle to the Nazi-style antisemitic propaganda regularly consumed and believed in mainstream Arab media.



In short, the 1948 war saw expulsions/flight on both sides, sometimes unintentional, sometimes justified by military necessity, sometimes deliberate ethnic cleansing. Like every war in history.



The subsequent decades-long Jewish expulsion from Arab countries was just pure ethnic cleansing.



**4. Reparations:**



The Palestinian refugee population has received more international aid per capita than any other refugee population in history. Israel has also, in various peace negotiations since 1949, offered to allow some of the refugees to return and to pay out compensation for others.



As far as I know, no reparations or international aid of any kind was paid for the amelioration of the situation of Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and the issue was not even mentioned seriously in any peace negotiations.

(This point is only relevant insofar as Israel is held accountable for the continued disenfranchisement of the descendants of Palestinian refugees in their host countries. If we correctly discuss this issue separately, this point is not relevant.)



**Conclusion**



Even to bring up the Palestinian Nakba without a much heavier focus on the Jewish expulsions is to expose oneself as not interested in facts, or human rights, or correcting historical injustices.




It is, of course, valid for anyone to talk about anything they like and to not talk about anything they like. However, talking about the Nakba without mentioning the Jewish expulsions is bad for the following reasons:

1.	⁠The people who are loudest about the Nakba are often the same people who outright deny the Jewish expulsions.

2.	⁠In certain contexts, such as summarizing historical grievances and crimes of the Israeli-Arab conflict, or of making specific political demands for the resolution of the conflict, it would be racist and hypocritical to mention only one of these two events.

3.	⁠The Nakba, in particular, is often cited as the reason to delegitimize the state of Israel and claim that it should be dismantled, and that any dealings with Israel makes one complicit in the crime of the Nakba. If one is to be morally consistent, they must also apply the same standard to Egypt, Syria, Iran, Yemen, etc. The fact that they don’t indicates that they do not truly believe that an act of ethnic cleansing makes a country illegitimate.

We brought disaster upon a million Arab refugees by inviting them and bringing pressure on them to leave.

|26. “Abu Mazen Charges that the Arab States Are the Cause of the Palestinian Refugee Problem” *(Wall Street Journal;* June 5, 2003):|

Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) wrote an article in March 1976 in *Falastin al-Thawra,* the official journal of the PLO in Beirut: “The Arab armies entered Palestine to protect the Palestinians from the Zionist tyranny, but instead they abandoned them, forced them to emigrate and to leave their homeland, imposed upon them a political and ideological blockade and threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live in Eastern Europe.”

As Abu Mazen alluded, it was in large part due to threats and fear­mongering from Arab leaders that some 700,000 Arabs fled Israel in 1948 when the new state was invaded by Arab armies. Ever since, the growing refugee population, now around 4 million by UN estimates, has been corralled into squalid camps scattered across the Middle East - in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza, and the West Bank.

In 1950, the UN set up the United Nations Relief and Works Agency as a temporary relief effort for Palestinian refugees. Former UNRWA director Ralph Galloway stated eight years later that, “the Arab states do not want to solve the refugee problem. They want to keep it as an open sore, as a weapon against Israel. Arab leaders do not give a damn whether Arab refugees live or die. The only thing that has changed since \[1949\] is the number of Palestinians cooped up in these prison camps.”
